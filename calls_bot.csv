internal: Get that connection activated to the requested port.;;;
external: Okay, not a problem. So if it sorry, it's just on Port number one. Can you tell me if any other service providers are connected to port one still I spoke to mum and she said that she had it changed it over she, mm, because when I tried to connect to my Wifi today, mm, they disconnected months.;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
external: And so she got a call and mum's in Queensland at the moment and she got a call and mm, she called me and let me know that she's been disconnected but she spoke to them for a while on the phone and they said that they were moving her to port number two. So if I have to say port one.;;;
internal: Ok.;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
external: Does that mean that after she's been moved to port two officially on the system or whatever I will be able to use my Wifi.;;;
internal: Yes, because you have been already connected to port number one and it shows we are using the current line and it shows as well port number two three four three. So if your mom is getting ported to port number two, there won't be any issue for your connection.;;;

external: Yeah.;;;

internal: Yeah, that's fine.;;;
external: Do all the four lights meant to be green in device?;;;
internal: M green.;;;
external: No, it's not like I am asking you.;;;
internal: Yeah, so yeah, it should be solid green lights, There should be four solid lights.;;;
external: Ok.;;;
internal: Mm, at the moment, you are not having that right so.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: So basically you are supposed to have four green lights and if the Internet light is red on the modem that means the configuration is not correct. If the, the solid lights are there on the mbn device, but in this case you do not have two lights which are required.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;

external: Yeah, sure.;;;
internal: Awesome first thing first, just need to let you know, today's call may be recorded for coaching and quality, is that alright?;;;
external: Yeah, that's fine.;;;
internal: Awesome and then I'll just get your full name, your date of birth and your address there in point Cook.;;;
external: Twenty six seven nineteen seventy five six Wood Court, Victoria, three zero three zero.;;;
internal: Wonderful. And then the final thing is, I'll send you a text message with a code that I'll get you to read back to me for your security.;;;
external: Three five two four six.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Three five three four six.;;;
external: Got.;;;
internal: Awesome awesome. so, uh, you were, you were having some issues with the Mbn connection after it connected and you weren't finding that the super connection was working, Is that correct?;;;
external: Yeah, I'm still using the telstra one cause that's working.;;;
external: And the super up box.;;;
internal: Okay, yeah, so at the moment, it looks like you might have another modem plugged into the Super Loop line. so which unity or are you connected to on your M B M box?;;;
external: Currently telstra because other unit didn't work. so I pull it out and then use the old one telstra.;;;
internal: Yeah, so it's plugged into the unity, one on the Mbn box, is that correct?;;;
external: That's right, yeah.;;;
internal: Yeah, yeah, so that poor is now superb, it's not telstra. so you using the Telstra modem, you're still using the Super loop connection, okay.;;;
external: It's not telstra.;;;
internal: No, that one, there is super Loop. what it sounds like is the Z T E, the modem we gave you that wasn't working initially and you've swapped over to the telstra one and that one's working for you, is that correct?;;;
external: Uh.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Alright, no worries. And what was the issue with the Z E, was it just not connecting at all?;;;
external: Yeah, it was not connecting. so I used both, hmm, it was like five G one and then there was another one, both hmm the password worked and then after that it said no Internet.;;;
internal: No worries. And when you connected it all up, you have the Internet cable running from unity one to the red poor on the back of the Z T E.;;;
external: That's yes exactly.;;;
internal: Yeah and did your factory reset that said to you at all?;;;
external: Hmm, well, I didn't do any reset so it was out of the box so yeah.;;;
internal: Yeah, no worries. What I'm wondering is, it might have been configured for an optic connection which obviously you never had optic and that was our mistake. So what I'd like to try and do if you've got some time is factor and reset the Z t and see if we can get it working for you.;;;
external: Uh.;;;
external: Right, but if that is work if you are saying that the old one is working and it's a super connection, mm, well, I don't need this to be honest, you know.;;;
internal: Yeah, I.;;;
external: Is not going to bill me.;;;
internal: No Telstra is not going to bill you what would have happened, is when we connected, we would have transferred the Telstra connection over to Super Loop.;;;
external: So I won't have like two connection at the same time. like I'm not paying two bills at the same time technically.;;1;
internal: Yeah, that's correct. If for whatever reason, let's say we connected on Unity two instead of unity one, then you would have had an issue with two connections. but I can confirm that we're on unity one and that the other ports being two three and four. they're all showing is free according to M B n code, so you only have one connection.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Oh, okay, right, okay, so.;;;
external: Then you know, I can just continue using the modem if this is not working since my time, you know, if they're saying that it's an active line with super.;;;
external: Then you know.;;;
external: I was on this morning.;;;
internal: Yeah, absolutely. and if for whatever reason you find leaders on the line that you want to try the Z T E out, mm, you can just give us a call and we can try and set it up for you if you'd like.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Also.;;;
external: So but if I don't need this modem, I can just return it back, yeah.;;;
internal: Ah, so because it's been opened, we can't return it, mm, bear with me for just a sec.;;;
internal: Cause our hardware guys won't take it back.;;;
external: Uh.;;;
internal: What I might get you to do is if you do have a bit of patience, is leave it with me And I'll see what I can do about that one in particular and get back to you by the end of the day. Um, we might not be able to accept a return but I might be able to work something else out for you, okay.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Ok, that's fine.;;;
internal: Awesome, I will get back to you by the end of the day and I really appreciate you taking the time to answer my call and I'm sorry again. I couldn't call yesterday.;;;
external: No, that's fine. And I haven't actually received the refund from optic on, that's still like pending. I've been pressing up a couple of payments. No one responded so.;;;
external: Is that something has should only been with them or?;;;
internal: Go ahead.;;;
internal: Yeah, unfortunately, we can't put any pressure on them with that one mm.;;;
external: I can send it.;;;
internal: Yeah, I'll see if I can get any advice to give you in regards to that but we don't, we can't chase up the refund for you. but I might be able to get some some advice for you in that regard as well, okay.;;;

internal: Alright, let me check for so when are you moving into this address exactly?;;;
external: Uh.;;;
external: It's, em, let me see it's Se, September the first.;;;
internal: First of September.;;;
external: Friday, this Friday.;;;
internal: This Friday, okay. no worries. Let me run a quick check for the address. Let me verify on that. it will go from there.;;;
internal: Looks like it's qualify for an M B M service. I'm just wanting to check on the M B M portal, uh, give me a moment. let me just get verified.;;;
internal: Everything seems to be in place there seems to be an active service on the property. So should be the current tenant. So the activation date needs to be the first of September, right.;;;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: So do you want the current service address services that are cancelled on the first or is there an overlap for you?;;;
external: Hmm, make making an overlap please.;;;
internal: So one needs to be cancelled.;;;

external: The second date, please so.;;;
internal: Second.;;;
external: So.;;;
external: Uh, the second of September.;;;
internal: September, no worries. I'll get that done.;;;
internal: Okay, right. so with the relocation of the service, Do you want to relocate with the same speed that you're on or do you want to consider a different plan?;;;
external: I'm considering a different plan, uh, cause I, I don't think we use, you know, we fully used the services. you guys provide at the current, hmm price to.;;;
internal: Okay, which do you want to go with?;;;
internal: Okay, okay. so you're looking for a cheaper and a slower speed plan or cheaper, okay. So currently on the hundred by forty, uh, so the next plan down would be hundred by twenty, that is sixty nine for the first six months after that. It'll be eighty five and the plan below that is fifty by twenty that is fifty nine for the first six months.;;;
external: Yeah, yeah, yeah.;;;
internal: As well, it will be seventy five.;;;
internal: So it's a small different eighty five, uh, so I would recommend at least stick to the fifty by when you can ask you, what do you usually use your Internet for?;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
external: Hmm, only for, you know, website and.;;;
external: Yeah, maybe, uh, after I moved in, I would probably use kind of network streaming services.;;;
internal: Ok, right. so you norm work from home, yeah.;;;
external: I work from home but it's not love. It's just, you know, not that.;;;
internal: It's not a lot right, right. No worries. understand. so let's go in then fifty by twenty cause that'll be the ideal speeds for you. so which is fifty nine for the first six months after that. It'll be seventy five, would that be fine or is that too slow speed?;;;
external: Yeah, I think it will be fine, Let's try and after that, can we can I just upgrade if it's not?;;;
internal: It will be fine.;;;
internal: Yeah, you can, but yeah, sure, sure, no worries. But keep in mind if you do any changes within the first six months period, you lose your promotional pricing so I would recommend for you to stick to apply for the first six months so fifty by when he should do it for you or do you think the speed might not be enough?;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: I think, hmm, I think we will be fine.;;;
internal: It will be fine, okay, no worries. So I do have to research a member's portal pass. So I can get the new account added in. Could you verify me your email address please?;;;

internal: Mhm.;;;
external: Now you can't turn around and say please pay it. This is the amount and you've got to pay it by credit card because that's the only way it will let you do it and then you charge me an account processing fee and then try to debit that from that same account And then charge me another ten dollars because I, I've put a block on that on El from debiting my account.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: It's patel's problem. you cannot charge me a card processing fee for paying a bill.;;;
external: Not when you don't advise me in advance and or incorporate that.;;;
external: Account processing fee in the built you need to say there's an additional whatever the dollar seventeen added to that bill for a card process.

So if I pay that dollar seventeen on the website then you will charge me another account, a credit card fee which will.;;;

internal: Oh, I do.;;;
external: About.;;;
external: If we need to change the cable, we can do, but hmm, so this is the cable that came with my router. So I've connected that to the land, um, but originally we had this cable connected into here which was connected to the lance and then our router.;;;

internal: The.;;;
external: N.;;;

external: Em.;;;
internal: And yeah, just, yeah, just make sure that you are putting the proper password. I mean the upper case and lower case as it is on the email or Sms, yeah.;;;
external: I seen.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: So do I need to do anything with optional settings?;;;
internal: Uh, no, you can leave as a default and you can continue I mean.;;;
external: Okay and then it's got I P Tv forward slash v, la settings that's off. I think that's supposed to be off.;;;
internal: Just leave it as a default or channel that should be fine, yeah.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Alright, we'll go next.;;;
internal: Yeah, so the only option, yep. the only thing is, you will have to change it to Triple Ppoe and enter your, uh, log in details there, that's it.;;;
external: Alright.;;;
external: Yeah, okay. Let's, let's see if this works because that didn't come up last night which is really strange because I did it that many times.;;;
external: To not have got half that bit, hmm.;;;
internal: It off.;;;
external: I can't remember what that one is.;;;
external: Okay, hopefully this works now then.;;;
internal: Cool.;;;
external: But yeah, none of that option came up last night which is so strange because I know I was given and I thought where am I supposed to put that bit in.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Yeah, so did you so last time? Did you select the triple option or did you select any other options?;;;
external: I didn't get that. it didn't get the option to pull that up.;;;
external: This is really strange.;;;
internal: Yeah, usually that is usually if you select the triple P option, it comes up.;;;
internal: Username and the password.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Oh, I think.;;;
external: I may be connected, gosh.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Maybe it's green and it hasn't been green before so maybe that's a good s.;;;
internal: Oh.;;;
external: Not pressing it, okay. sorry, I feel like this has been such a pain, the last day.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Em, oh, ok, so it's now set up not shit.;;;
external: Okay, everything looks good. So alright. I think I'll have to, let me see if I can turn my hotspot off because that's what.;;;
external: Um.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
external: Let me have a look.;;;
external: And it's not, so Wifi settings.;;;
external: Yeah, ok.;;;
external: Right.;;;
external: But it's still not connecting to the.;;;
external: Maybe it's because it's still checking.;;;
external: Um.;;;
external: Do you think it could be that, it will take a while for my Wifi to set up.;;;
internal: Yeah, uh, maximum. it will take like five to ten minutes maximum. I don't think it will take more than that.;;;
external: Okay, no worries. So the fact that the, the router's connected.;;;
external: Em, I do have a question for you, hmm.;;;
internal: Yeah, sure.;;;
external: There is a way because at the moment, em, obviously there's a username and password, em, how do we, em?;;;
external: We stop others from going on because the username and password, so I think that's all we need to do, isn't it.;;;
internal: Sorry, I wouldn't get you.;;;
external: That's okay, don't worry, em.;;;

external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Okay, just reply back to that email with the requested details because men has asked more information about the service.;;;
external: Oh, look that's the problem. No, no, no, that's the reason I've called the reason I've called I spoke to someone yesterday and they said that you know, M B M asked for the details. I actually got the, the real estate people to go to the property and check for the box number Now. What they informed me that. They're really lovely to actually help. they informed me that the previous tenants there.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: The previous rentals there had mbn with Iinet. They had a box there and everything. However, I think they're a little bit too cheap, so what has happened is when they have left, They've actually taken the box as well. so they've actually asked Iinet to remove the box. so they can get refunded whatever money, they're going to get refunded.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
internal: So they have to take on the M B N device, is it?;;;
external: They have taken the N C D box. it's called they said he said to me, it's been taken out. So there's no box there because of the stupid of them, yeah.;;;
internal: There's no box, okay. Jeremy. could you confirm the, uh, the new address for me just to make sure I'm looking at the right?;;;
external: Yes.;;;
external: Yeah, its, uh, unit one.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
external: Number three.;;;
internal: Number three, ok.;;;
external: Ben Bridge Avenue, That's B E N B R I.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: In Frank.;;;
internal: France in South Victoria, three one double nine, right?;;;
external: Correct.;;;
external: So all the houses in in the complex have mbn and the box there, but I think I believe that's what happens which makes sense. why, why we don't have anything.;;;
internal: Okay, let me check, alright.;;;
external: Bye.;;;
internal: I think the problem we have is unit one number three Bambridge Avenue. It's not available on the M B M portal, right, uh, hold on.;;;
external: Yes.;;;
external: Yeah, correct. so the problem I am seeing is though is that because I have had m b N in all my other houses now so far and with all of them. We've had the box outside. We've had the, when we've had the connection created. There's, so there is definitely a fibre that goes to the entire property, the entire property including unit.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: One, there's fire there. however, what has happened is the idiots who are living there before us. They are just like I said it's too cheap and they've taken the whole thing out including the box so they've got Iinet to take it out. So what he's suggested is, he said that he might, I might have to get you guys to speak to Iinet or whoever in order to get.;;;
internal: Uh, uh.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: Going again because it seems like they've obviously done some stupid mistake there and they pulled it up And I don't want to keep changing provider I like you guys so far and I want to stick so I was hoping to get the solution organized. So you know by next week we can actually happen. we moved there next weekend. We can have the Internet there.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: I understand, yeah.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Okay, well, so hmm here, uh, Jeremiah. I found three addresses in the M B N portal, right one is just number three Bambridge Avenue, the second address is.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Correct, that's the, that's the property, yeah, correct.;;;
internal: Okay, The second address is Unit two number three Bambridge Avenue. The other one is Unit three number three, Ben Ridge Avenue and then unit four unit five likewise, right, so are you in just three Bambridge Avenue?;;;
external: Correct.;;;
external: Exactly, yeah.;;;
external: No, no, no, no, see that's the thing it. I don't know what it is showing as it could just be three Bens Avenue.;;;
internal: But you're not a hundred percent sure, right.;;;
external: Because it's the first house.;;;
external: Yeah, because my, the thing is, it's an apartment, its sorry, it's not apartment, it's units and there's there's about eight town houses attached to each other and mine is the first one. So I believe I have a feeling that it could actually just be listed as number three rather than unit one.;;;
internal: It is a town.;;;
internal: It must be just.;;;
internal: Great.;;;
internal: Right.;;;
external: Because there definitely like I said he, they checked it. He said that you know it used to be there. He's, he's definitely sure of that and the thing is the way I see it, you can't put a, you can't put a fibre.;;;
internal: Well.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: Past the first house without, you know, tapping into the first house and then go through all the rest of the houses, yeah.;;;
internal: I know, yeah.;;;
internal: I know, okay, one second. so what happened was the agent, the very first day when you poor. we have sent an email to, uh, mbn asking to update the address as unit one slash three, Ben Bridge Avenue, right. And then they have what they have said is.;;;
external: Sorry.;;;
external: Yeah, so yeah.;;;
external: They asked for a serial number on the box, is that correct?;;;
internal: Serial number but you don't have that right.;;;
external: Yeah, well, that's the thing there's notice because these like I said these people are, I think they were just pro. I think they were stupid and I think they pulled it out themselves because what's happened is even when I saw the house there, you know, they've made some stupid changes here and they're all ridiculous stuff. So I believe what's happened is they've basically gone and done the wrong thing.;;;
internal: Okay, so then.;;;
internal: Done the wrong thing, yeah.;;;
internal: Can I put you on hold for a moment. I'll have a word with my manager as well see what we can do And I'll be back with you sooner, right?;;;
external: Absolutely, yes, yes.;;;
external: Yeah, not a problem at all. Thank you so much.;;;

internal: Uh.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: No.;;;
internal: Hi Jemma. Thank you so much for being online. I think we will be sending another email to Mbn. The thing is hmm. We can tell them the N T D device was removed by the previous Asian and you.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: I've already sent the proof of Occupancy document which shows the address as unit one, uh, slash three Bambridge Avenue. Uh, we'll have to wait til, M gets back to us on this like first step. We were taken to like try to get the address updated in the portal but now we have come across with another.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Yes, yeah.;;;
internal: So we'll see what Mbn says and we can give an update in about two business days, alright.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Okay, yeah, that's perfectly fine. Now. Would you recommend I just call and ask them what the issue was cause obviously they are the ones who are sing the property to start with and they cause it.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: Well, okay, Can you do a favour if you can get a lock Id from Iinet then we can make sure if it was connected to just three Bambridge Avenue. If you can do that actually, this will make so much easier for you and m b m as well.;;;
external: Lock Id, is it?;;;
internal: Lock, I D, yeah, it starts with L O C.;;;
external: Oh, L O C y, find the lock I d, no worries.;;;
internal: Yeah, number, yeah, okay. just get that number for us and then we will escalate to M B was the address connected to M B M previously, but the.;;;
internal: The tenants have taken the device and I think in being cancelled out the matter more promptly in that way.;;;
external: Ok, that's fantastic. What I'll do in that case is, I'll fill it now. I'll try to get a hold of them and then I'll be able to essentially see what what we can do to fix it then because like I said I want to just get it get it all day up to date and start it there. So it ends here on the same day starts there and then we can also just wanted to get a couple more things from you guys organized as well just for the.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: I complete that.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Higher speed and the, and the modem type and things like that. So that could be, we could actually that awesome look. I'll call them now. Actually I'll let you go, I'll call them now and then once I have a chat with them. I can give you guys a call back.;;;

internal: Uh, yeah, no as this connection. there's, no, there's no, any requirement of an M B M box. once you receive the modem, you will just have to get it connected connected to a telephone fall socket and a power outlet. then you will be able to like you will be able to get this like you will be able to use the connection.;;;
internal: This connection is active like it has been gone for like if I am to give you a clear picture. You have requested for a fibre upgrade to the premature upgrade, okay. The procedure would be first of all we will be getting you, the ft connection, the fibre to the, no connection active.;;;
external: Yes, yes.;;;
internal: Once that is active only, we will be proceeding with the fibre to the premises connection because as per your location, we can straight away proceed with the fibre to the premises connection because the infrastructure and all those things have not been built. So the usual procedure with Mbn recommends it first. We get the Fibre connection active.;;;
external: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: To get the Fibre connection active, you won't like there won't be any technical which would be required. Once you receive the modem. Please plug the modem to the power outlet and to the wall, okay. And once the service service is active, you will be able to use the connection and then once the fibre to the note connect.;;1;
internal: In active fibre to the premises plan upgrade will be processing for that. there would be a tech which would be required. Uh, will be providing all those details once the order has been processed.;;1;
external: So when will my fire to the, not be activated?;;;
internal: Uh, like if you have a modem with you like the modem has not been shipped out yet because the payment has been done through a direct debit payment. So usually it would take half around three to four days for the verification to be sorted out once the verification is passed. then only the modem will be getting dispatched.;;;
internal: So in that case, if you have a spare modem like if you have another modem with you, which you could use until the new modem arrives, you will be able to get the connection up and running now it says.;;;
external: Yes, so I have a spare modem with me. Are you able to send us the settings required, so I can do it?;;;
internal: Oh shoot.;;;
internal: Sure, sure, no problem. Shall I get the connection up and running first and then once along with the connection activation notification, you will be receiving the modem configuration details as well.;;;
external: After what?;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Okay, Would you mind giving me a couple of minutes until I get everything updated?;;;

internal: Uh.;;;
external: By.;;;
internal: Hello, thank you for staying on line.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Yes, you have updated all the things which are required for the activation to a supplier. So the usual time frame would be a twenty four hour time frame for the activation to trigger on, but there are possibilities where it could happen within a couple of hours as well. So once you receive the notification, please get your modem configured as well the modem which you have now so that you could.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Use the connection and please get the modem plugged into the wall socket and the power outlet as well.;;;
external: Okay, so you're gonna, I'm gonna get an email for the configuration.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
internal: Uh, yes, you will be receiving an email for the configuration and with regards to the new modem which has been requested. I see the payments have been updated today. it shows that it has been updated today. So it, it would be roughly around four days for the verification to be done And hopefully on the sixth of September, the modem, the new modem which was.;;;
internal: Requested, we'll be getting dispatched.;;;
external: Okay, cool, okay. Thank you so much. So you have done everything and we'll just have to wait for the configuration.;;;
internal: No.;;;
internal: No.;;;

external: It's two green lights solid, yeah.;;;
internal: Two green lights, uh.;;;
internal: Can you tell me what the lights are?;;;
external: It could be.;;;
external: Em, no power and.;;;
external: It says optical.;;;
internal: That green.;;;
internal: Alright, so, uh, is there a unit one light, uh, maybe?;;;
external: Sorry, what number?;;;
internal: Un one.;;;
external: Not all.;;;
internal: U N I.;;;
internal: Can you check if the cables are connected, right?;;;
external: Well, nothing's been changed.;;;
external: We've got a Wifi light on on the modem now still orange on the front.;;;
internal: Alright, so you're supposed to have three lights on the M b n, so one one would be the power light then the optical light and the other one should be the Uni D light on top. So basically that indicates the connection coming into the modem.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: It is not on.;;;
internal: All right.;;;
external: Maybe the not work.;;;
internal: Em.;;;
internal: That is a possibility, hmm. Could you probably check if your modem is correctly connected through to the w, the Van Port.;;;
internal: And to the M B N device.;;;
internal: It should be connected through to the one port.;;;
external: As I say nothing has been changed down it, it hasn't been touched or moved the year.;;;
external: There's no light on.;;;
external: No, you be one or two or three or four. None of those lights are on.;;;
internal: So I'm running a few tests on M B M, just give me a few minutes, alright.;;;
internal: Alright, hmm. so I checked on Mbn and I ran a few tests from my end. So it seems that the modem is not being detected.;;;
internal: Hmm, that's what they indicate over here. So do you maybe have a spare Internet cable that you would try?;;;
external: Um.;;;
external: I do but.;;;
external: Well, I think I'm going to have to do call you back at some stage. I've really gotta go now, um.;;;
internal: Okay, hmm, uh.;;;
external: But you want me to try another cable at.;;;
internal: Yes, yeah, so Internet cable should go into the one port and to the van port of the modem. just try swapping the cable. I think it should work out because based on the N B N test that I just ran, it says that the modem is not being detected to check whether the Internet cable is connected curve.;;;
internal: Correctly or to change the Internet cable and then test it off.;;;
external: Alright, well, yeah, okay.;;;
internal: Alright, hmm, just just check that out sir. And I think the logins are setting correct. and the settings are correct. Now. It's just that the modem is not, uh, maybe the cables sometimes they can, I mean you may have not moved it around for years. but sometimes they can be faulty after some time, so.;;;
internal: It's best to just for it and just check it out afterwards. if in case the issue persists, you could call us back.;;;
external: Yeah, I'll do that. okay. Then. thank you for your help.;;;

external: The box.;;;
internal: When you are trying to connect to Wifi.;;;

internal: Yes, uh.;;;
external: So.;;;
internal: That the five G is the fastest one, uh, but five G is working til five metres, but two point four is working ten metres, but it gives you an average speed.;;;
external: So five G works for two meters. Did you say two meters.;;;
internal: Five pietre.;;;
external: Five meter.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Mm.;;;

internal: And a stable, uh.;;;
internal: So.;;;
internal: Five two, yeah.;;;
external: Yeah, okay, alright.;;;
internal: But but the distance that.;;;
internal: Wifi five G distance normally from the modem to your Diversity is working five metres if you are using extender, it will increase that rate.;;;
external: The extender will.;;;
internal: Yeah, except the building.;;;
external: Okay, alright, mm, hopefully I can set up the extender if not can, can you guys help me set that up?;;;

internal: Get that connection activated to the requested port.;;;
external: Okay, not a problem. So if it sorry, it's just on Port number one.

internal: Okay.;;;
external: And so she got a call and mum's in Queensland at the moment and she got a call and mm, she called me and let me know that she's been disconnected but she spoke to them for a while on the phone and they said that they were moving her to port number two. So if I have to say port one.;;;
internal: Ok.;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
external: Does that mean that after she's been moved to port two officially on the system or whatever I will be able to use my Wifi.;;;
internal: Yes, because you have been already connected to port number one and it shows we are using the current line and it shows as well port number two three four three. So if your mom is getting ported to port number two, there won't be any issue for your connection.;;;

internal: Sure.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;

external: Okay.;;;

internal: Thank you for holding, I for the wait, hello.;;;
external: Hello.;;;
internal: Hi, so I did some troubleshooting actually. I was able to see the N P M box is online and everything is passing but M P M box is not detecting your modem. So that means the, the main issue is with your cabling and can you please check and let me know is in the modem if the broadband light is on.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Which one.;;;
internal: The broadband light is on in the model, it's not okay. so that means clearly, there is an issue between the connection. So so you told me that you are connecting to the wall socket. So that means you guys, you have Internet wiring in the house. so the thing since we m and exit.;;;
external: No, it's not, that's not not.;;;
internal: We can guarantee up to the M B M boundary point that means the M B M box after that, that means your internal wiring. so probably you need to check the internal wiring so.;;;
internal: So before that let's confirm the service if you don't mind, can you please take the modem and the cabling cable to your garage and connect the modem directly to the M B M box as a trouble shooting step to see if it comes online.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: One second, yeah, this M B M box is am I able to open it or not?;;;
internal: Yeah, sure.;;;

external: Yeah, removed here. so the power is on and then the optical is on as well.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: Okay, so the.;;;
external: But there's no.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah, yeah, you can talk.;;;
internal: Yeah, so probably the Id is off. So basically you provision port is the Id one port. So you need to connect the modem to the U I D one port. So if you don't mind, uh, connect the modem to the U I D port one and see if the services come service comes online.;;;
external: Yeah, but how, how do I find this? Oh, yeah, okay. so I have to connect it directly in there one second. I'll try to connect you, give me one second.;;;
internal: Yeah, exactly, yeah.;;;
internal: Sure.;;;
external: So the morning has to stay here directly on the, on the M B M box.;;;
internal: Uh, no, actually you should, you will be able to get it get it inside but you need to figure out. what's the issue with the internal wiring. So are you renting this property? Do you go or are you on this property renting then probably give your landlord or the property manager a call and let them know about your issue. so they will be able to advise.;;;
external: Yeah, yeah.;;;
internal: You on how to connect the internal wire because since you are in a two story house, probably they have internal wiring and they will be able to help you out with the internal wiring as soon as you figure out the internal wiring, you will be able to connect your modem inside and then the service will, you will be able to use the Internet properly inside. You will be able to place the modem inside and get a.;;;
external: Uh.;;;
internal: Get a better Wifi signal. So I'm, I just asked you to connect it directly because I need to make sure the service is working fine, then you will be able to, yeah.;;;
external: Yeah, yeah.;;;
external: It's now, I got the after connecting to U I D one, I got the broadband and Internet lights on the modem working.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
internal: Ok, uh, let me check.;;;
external: But I don't have the five G working yet only two point four now five G is is on now.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
external: Internet is showing red, it's showing in red now like two errors, but it's still in red.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: Still turned green because it's still on the starting process because it's still authenticating.;;;
external: Oh gotcha, yeah, now it's everything turned everything off, but the power one power one's, the only one working at the moment.;;;
internal: Yeah, yeah, so this is, this is the basic set up process because this is the first time you are connecting the modem. Some modem will go through restart the, at least two times then probably come online, let's see.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
external: Got it, okay.;;;
external: So do you think after doing all this set up. I will be able to disconnect from the, from the garage and connect laptop or not.;;;
internal: Eh, you, the thing is, it will depend on the internal wiring. if you don't have any issues with the internal wiring and it properly maintain. and it's all good. then you will be able to connect the modem inside without any issues. You just need to find out. so what you need to let your, uh, property manager know, is let him know that you need.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
internal: To find the internal wiring leading cable so that means in the garage, there should be a cable that you need to plug into the U I D one port that means we need to get your modem connected with the U I D one. so in order to do that you need to connect the internal wiring to the U I D one and.;;;
internal: Then you need to, yeah, yeah, then it will power up the Internet wiring, then you will be able to connect your modem to the wall socket in the premises. But in order to do that you need to find out the internal wiring leading cable. so we don't have that information. unfortunately, otherwise I will definitely help you out so that's.;;;

internal: Yeah, I think it.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
internal: Yeah, it's.;;;
external: A second Orange cable like this one that you, you guys provided me with the morning, connect the M B M box to this cable on the, on the garage and then the M B M box will be connected to the top four, is that right the thinking?;;;
internal: Um.;;;

internal: I like to get.;;;
external: I think that I've changed all the cables. So at the moment, there's the yellow one, there was a blue one last night, but the problem is when this has been put in, it goes into the wall. If you're not careful, you have to be really really careful. So I'm trying not to move. I try not to touch that cable if I don't have to.;;;
internal: Oh, I do.;;;
external: About.;;;
external: If we need to change the cable, we can do, but hmm, so this is the cable that came with my router. So I've connected that to the land, um, but originally we had this cable connected into here which was connected to the lance and then our router.;;;
internal: Oh.;;;
external: Within another room with a cable that comes out of the wall to connect but I can't get it. I've tried both options and none of it works.;;;
internal: Yeah, I previously, how was your Internet connected to, was it connected to this wall socket?;;;

internal: No, no, to where was it connected the black add up previously.;;;
external: That before it went down this week.;;;

internal: Was it connected.;;;
external: How old is the?;;;
internal: No, was it collected in the same place even before.;;;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: I mean it is in the, it was connected on the same socket, right?;;;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
internal: Yeah, can I know if I did send you any lock in details for your email or mobile?;;;
external: Uh, yes, except I don't know where I'm supposed to put them in cause when I go through the step by step guide on the app. It doesn't give me that option.;;;
internal: So when I'm going on the app and I know it should like to have the bpp or your option.;;;
external: Sorry.;;;
internal: Can I know on the app if it gives a triple bpo, o app option.;;;
external: So I've got to reset up again cause I couldn't set it up last night so because it kept reaching and then said you've got no Internet, em, uh, try this one. Let me see it says detecting Internet connection type.;;;
internal: Yeah, can you select on that? Can you know what options do you have?;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Eh, it says.;;;
external: Okay, um, Internet connection p p P O E.;;;
internal: Yeah, can you select that check?;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: I've got.;;;
internal: Four.;;;
external: Should it be p P P O E or should it be, I'm guessing, it's got to be P P P O E because of the P O E, but I don't know.;;;
internal: So there is, yeah, Can you just read the options that is available there?;;;
external: Static I P L two T P P P T P D S light.;;;
internal: Alright, okay, can just select on triple p p o e, so it's P P or yeah, just select on that.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: The username is that where I put my new scope.;;;
internal: The.;;;
external: N.;;;
internal: Yes, yeah, yeah, the user name and the pass has to go in there.;;;
external: Ok.;;;
external: It didn't come up at all last night like I didn't have, um, and it's new dot com, is it dot com or dot com dot a u?;;;
internal: Its just dot com.;;;
external: Yeah, okay and then put my password in.;;;
external: Yeah, okay, right optional settings.;;;
internal: Well, I'm sorry, yeah, just a sec, it comes with so on the email. Can you check if it's with dot com dot a u or is it just dot com? So unfortunately we cannot see it from my end that is.;;;
external: Uh, let me see if there's any way I might be able to find out if somebody spoke to me about. I've just written it down it's the other pulled off.;;;
internal: Yeah, so actually your account user name is with dot a U, so I just want to double check if your user name also.;;;
external: Oh, yeah.;;;
internal: Has a.;;;
external: Ok, I dot a U O.;;;
internal: Uh, yeah, can I just check your email or the Sms that you received it with a or?;;;
external: Yeah, I've got Shantel at new s dot com dot a U.;;;
internal: Alright, yeah, then you can put on there as well.;;;
external: Yeah, ok, then I've got the password and then it says optional settings.;;;
external: Em.;;;
internal: And yeah, just, yeah, just make sure that you are putting the proper password. I mean the upper case and lower case as it is on the email or Sms, yeah.;;;
external: I seen.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: So do I need to do anything with optional settings?;;;
internal: Uh, no, you can leave as a default and you can continue I mean.;;;
external: Okay and then it's got I P Tv forward slash v, la settings that's off. I think that's supposed to be off.;;;
internal: Just leave it as a default or channel that should be fine, yeah.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Alright, we'll go next.;;;
internal: Yeah, so the only option, yep. the only thing is, you will have to change it to Triple Ppoe and enter your, uh, log in details there, that's it.;;;
external: Alright.;;;
external: Yeah, okay. Let's, let's see if this works because that didn't come up last night which is really strange because I did it that many times.;;;
external: To not have got half that bit, hmm.;;;
internal: It off.;;;
external: I can't remember what that one is.;;;
external: Okay, hopefully this works now then.;;;
internal: Cool.;;;
external: But yeah, none of that option came up last night which is so strange because I know I was given and I thought where am I supposed to put that bit in.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Yeah, so did you so last time? Did you select the triple option or did you select any other options?;;;
external: I didn't get that. it didn't get the option to pull that up.;;;
external: This is really strange.;;;
internal: Yeah, usually that is usually if you select the triple P option, it comes up.;;;
internal: Username and the password.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Oh, I think.;;;
external: I may be connected, gosh.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Maybe it's green and it hasn't been green before so maybe that's a good s.;;;
internal: Oh.;;;
external: Not pressing it, okay. sorry, I feel like this has been such a pain, the last day.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Em, oh, ok, so it's now set up not shit.;;;
external: Okay, everything looks good. So alright. I think I'll have to, let me see if I can turn my hotspot off because that's what.;;;
external: Um.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
external: Let me have a look.;;;
external: And it's not, so Wifi settings.;;;
external: Yeah, ok.;;;
external: Right.;;;
external: But it's still not connecting to the.;;;
external: Maybe it's because it's still checking.;;;
external: Um.;;;
external: Do you think it could be that, it will take a while for my Wifi to set up.;;;
internal: Yeah, uh, maximum. it will take like five to ten minutes maximum. I don't think it will take more than that.;;;
external: Okay, no worries. So the fact that the, the router's connected.;;;
external: Em, I do have a question for you, hmm.;;;
internal: Yeah, sure.;;;
external: There is a way because at the moment, em, obviously there's a username and password, em, how do we, em?;;;
external: We stop others from going on because the username and password, so I think that's all we need to do, isn't it.;;;
internal: Sorry, I wouldn't get you.;;;
external: That's okay, don't worry, em.;;;
external: Alright, so I think it's still doing something.;;;

internal: No, so actually no, so can I know we are checking this download option is it on the website or is it like checking through the app.;;;
external: Oh.;;;
external: It's through the app.;;;

internal: Just a five digit code so good man.;;;
external: Yeah, getting the phone to work is.;;;
external: Oh here we go, oh here, we got this one.;;;
internal: Nice.;;;
external: Is it two four three o three?;;;
internal: And then test that, yes, it is spot on alright. So you want static I P, so you went from Fibre to the curb to to the prim?;;;
external: That's what.;;;
internal: Alright, let me just open up them service. So the old service billing will stop in seven days and you'll get a pro credit. so your invoices that's what that's all about, okay. So let's go look this your services here.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Waiting for the computer to show me. you got Fibre to them indeed here it is so you see that.;;;
internal: Okay and looking for a static I P, you happy with the five dollars per month fee for static.;;;
external: Yes unfortunately.;;;
internal: Okay, yeah, so you have to get the approval for that for sure, okay. What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do it in two steps. I'm gonna put you onto a dynamic first and then I'll to a static are using your I P V six, probably not.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Well, it's one of those things that I've been sort of playing around with a little bit hmm and.;;;
internal: Need to be pretty high technical sort of to know how to use that. hmm. I'll, I'll leave it enabled anyway so just in case.;;1;
external: Yeah, that's right.;;;
external: Yeah, yeah, I leave it on I'm aiming to go to to use that sort of a lot more, but it's just finding the time to get everything configured properly. But I have, I have had a couple of little goes at it. and it's, uh, definitely something, we would like to use, yeah, sure.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Alright, so it's on dynamic at the moment, so it's cge the dynamic and then I move it to static. so the current Ip would just go to static and stay as is and then I'll make sure that you can still save the Internet so five dollars per month here. we go so your current Ip address, uh, for.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Ill just refresh the screen here is one two two.;;;
internal: Dot one nine nine.;;;
external: Two two.;;;
external: One nine nine, yeah.;;;
internal: Dot twenty six dot eighty four.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Can you check for me that you can still search the Internet right now?;;;
external: Oh, hang on our router's probably not switched over, but I'll just, I'm just onto it, that's fine.;;;
internal: It shows.;;;
external: Okay on.;;;
external: Done it just got to find the right screen. I've got a million screens open as usual.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: So just do a simple Google search that will confirm if you have got live access.;;;
external: Yeah, okay. I'll, I'll just ask Google. I just, uh, what's my Ip address, it's amazing isn't gos.;;;
internal: It is absolutely, yeah, say new fibre to the home connected working.;;;
external: It's okay, I put the thing in.;;;
external: And.;;;
external: But it looks like my Internet is just not working at the same. I'm gonna, I'll just try and get onto my router if I can find the right screen here it is.;;;
internal: I'm not sure that it should be.;;;
external: Um.;;;
external: Status.;;;
external: Interfaces.;;;
external: It's not, uh, oh, yeah, what twenty six eighty four. that's what you said was that, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, well, the router's picked up the D H C P address that's fine so.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Just drop authentication there. can, I will just refresh the screen here. so it's just drop authentication for no reason unless he's done something in your router. Can I get you to lift the, the network cable in the router out and back in again?;;;
external: Uh, yeah, it could be this firewall. it just, it tends to take its time to to, uh, market gateway is up. So it, it takes it can takes out five minutes before it decides that the gateway is live. So we're using I'm using something called Ps sensor. I don't know if it's coming across that which is sort of like a.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: Sounds like, you're all up to date, probably more than I am.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: I'm sure it's gonna be work. I'm sure it's gonna be okay. this. I mean it's picked up the new Ip address that you've given us with the D Happ. So I'm sure it'll be fine.;;;
internal: So it's probably done a release and trying to recover now.;;;
external: It yes, but as I say the actual, hmm Pf stand, Fi will decide sort of waits for about five minutes before it decides that it's going to actually flag the gateway as well even though the Ip address has changed. So I'm sure it'll be fine. So I'll give you a call back if there's any problems.;;;

internal: Just give me a moment, just give me a moment.;;;
internal: Like.;;;
internal: Anyways, what I'll do is, I'll lodge in a fault with the Mbn as well, right.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: And see what, what is going on so but at the same time, it's better if you can.;;;
internal: Look into this issue as well, just give me a moment, I'll try to log in a fault, okay.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: You sure, the cable is connected properly, right?;;;

internal: Can you remove the cable and can you remove the cable from the outlet and fix it back again?;;;
internal: Do you have another cable with you?;;;
external: Now.;;;
external: No, we've had this, we, we have had this issue before to be honest. They told us there was a wiring issue and.;;;
internal: So then before you know to B, it's better if you can fix it from your end.;;;
internal: Because if they do the test and find the same resource.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Then it will be, I think it's better if you can sort out the issue from your end first.;;;
external: Okay, um.;;;

internal: Thank you for holding apologize for the wait, hello.;;;
external: Yeah, hi.;;;
internal: Hi Sam. so I did some quick remote testing and I went through the previous cases as well. I'm sure sorry for the inconvenience so since you are using exit provided modems. I will be able to remotely log into the modem and check on it configuration to see if there are any issues with that as well, Is it okay if I try to log into the modem remotely?;;;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
external: Yeah, so just so you know the two point four g, we can connect to two point five, nothing like we can connect not working at all.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Not working at all, ok.;;;
external: And they are both flashing on the modem.;;;
internal: Okay, uh, so let me log into the modem and would you be able to, let me know the back address of the modem, it should be in the back of the modem.;;;
external: Yeah, once.;;;
internal: Sure.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
external: So what did you wanna know?;;;
internal: Uh, in the back of the modem, there is a sticker in that sticker, there should be something called Mac.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah, okay, so it's seven four.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: Six F.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
external: Eight eight.;;;
external: C B.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
external: S S.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: C.;;;
internal: Okay. Thank you for that and can you please? let me know is this started recently, did it started recently or or?;;;
external: Well, we had an outage on Monday and Tuesday and it came back online yesterday ago and since then it's been it's been slow.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Okay, okay, what about the distance between the devices and the modem so usually five day is not suitable for longer ranges. so it is not a long range. so it is probably since you are a shop.;;;
external: Well, it's, it's not far and we have an extender anyway so.;;;
internal: Not far.;;;
internal: Okay, you have extended.;;;
external: It shouldn't matter and before the outage it was all working fine.;;;
internal: Okay, so the thing is, so this can be the thing is there's a possibility, uh, after the outage, the modem needs to be reconfigure modem has been affected by the outage or something like that. The thing is that the extend that you?;;;
external: Mm.;;;
internal: Uh, you're using, is it an exit one or is it a third party because I'm not detecting extender third party?;;;
external: Third third party, but we're third party, we're not, we're not connecting to network connecting directly to the.;;;
internal: Wifi modem, okay. In that case so I went through the case history as well. Uh, I would like to suggest a factory is to the modem because they can be issued with the modem configuration that happens because of the outage. so we can, we can do a factories to the modem.;;;
external: Hmm Wifi.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: And then, uh, we will be able to check to check to see if most of the times, these type of issues can be resolved by a quick factory reset, but I need to let you know Sam since you are you guys are running a business? I need to let you know if you guys have done any customized changes to the modem as an example if you guys change.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Your Wifi names, Wifi passwords or unique.;;;
external: No, it's all. it's all just based off what it was.;;;
internal: Okay, so that means so usually do you, do you have a security system configure to the modem anything a C cctv or something like that or any port forward?;;;
external: Uh, yea, we do.;;;
internal: Uh, huh, that's the thing is if you have done the done, those specific configurations to the modem. you might need to, you need to reconfigure the modem again And I'm not, I won't be able to help you out with that. So that's why I need to confirm.;;;
external: Today.;;;
external: Is connecting to the Wifi that is it?;;;
internal: Disconnecting to the Wifi, ok, then you will be able to reconnect it through the Wifi.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Ok, so what is the device on the land one, is that you are extended?;;;
external: It's just a, eh, it's just a desktop.;;;
internal: Next, okay, okay. In that case I think we are good to go. So let's do a hard reset to the model. So in order to do this reset you will be able to see in the top of the modem. there is a small hale. So you need to get a pay for a pin place it inside the hall and press it down for eight to ten seconds.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: And you will be able to see all the lights in the modem, they will go off.;;;
external: Okay, one sec.;;;

external: Twenty six seven nineteen seventy five six Wood Court, Victoria, three zero three zero.;;;
internal: Wonderful. And then the final thing is, I'll send you a text message with a code that I'll get you to read back to me for your security.;;;
external: Three five two four six.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Three five three four six.;;;
external: Got.;;;
internal: Awesome awesome. so, uh, you were, you were having some issues with the Mbn connection after it connected and you weren't finding that the super connection was working, Is that correct?;;;
external: Yeah, I'm still using the telstra one cause that's working.;;;
external: And the super up box.;;;
internal: Okay, yeah, so at the moment, it looks like you might have another modem plugged into the Super Loop line. so which unity or are you connected to on your M B M box?;;;
external: Currently telstra because other unit didn't work. so I pull it out and then use the old one telstra.;;;
internal: Yeah, so it's plugged into the unity, one on the Mbn box, is that correct?;;;
external: That's right, yeah.;;;
internal: Yeah, yeah, so that poor is now superb, it's not telstra. so you using the Telstra modem, you're still using the Super loop connection, okay.;;;
external: It's not telstra.;;;
internal: No, that one, there is super Loop. what it sounds like is the Z T E, the modem we gave you that wasn't working initially and you've swapped over to the telstra one and that one's working for you, is that correct?;;;
external: Uh.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Alright, no worries. And what was the issue with the Z E, was it just not connecting at all?;;;
external: Yeah, it was not connecting. so I used both, hmm, it was like five G one and then there was another one, both hmm the password worked and then after that it said no Internet.;;;
internal: No worries. And when you connected it all up, you have the Internet cable running from unity one to the red poor on the back of the Z T E.;;;
external: That's yes exactly.;;;
internal: Yeah and did your factory reset that said to you at all?;;;
external: Hmm, well, I didn't do any reset so it was out of the box so yeah.;;;
internal: Yeah, no worries. What I'm wondering is, it might have been configured for an optic connection which obviously you never had optic and that was our mistake. So what I'd like to try and do if you've got some time is factor and reset the Z t and see if we can get it working for you.;;;
external: Uh.;;;
external: Right, but if that is work if you are saying that the old one is working and it's a super connection, mm, well, I don't need this to be honest, you know.;;;
internal: Yeah, I.;;;
external: Is not going to bill me.;;;
internal: No Telstra is not going to bill you what would have happened, is when we connected, we would have transferred the Telstra connection over to Super Loop.;;;
external: So I won't have like two connection at the same time. like I'm not paying two bills at the same time technically.;;1;
internal: Yeah, that's correct. If for whatever reason, let's say we connected on Unity two instead of unity one, then you would have had an issue with two connections. but I can confirm that we're on unity one and that the other ports being two three and four. they're all showing is free according to M B n code, so you only have one connection.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Oh, okay, right, okay, so.;;;
external: Then you know, I can just continue using the modem if this is not working since my time, you know, if they're saying that it's an active line with super.;;;
external: Then you know.;;;
external: I was on this morning.;;;
internal: Yeah, absolutely. and if for whatever reason you find leaders on the line that you want to try the Z T E out, mm, you can just give us a call and we can try and set it up for you if you'd like.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Also.;;;
external: So but if I don't need this modem, I can just return it back, yeah.;;;
internal: Ah, so because it's been opened, we can't return it, mm, bear with me for just a sec.;;;
internal: Cause our hardware guys won't take it back.;;;
external: Uh.;;;
internal: What I might get you to do is if you do have a bit of patience, is leave it with me And I'll see what I can do about that one in particular and get back to you by the end of the day. Um, we might not be able to accept a return but I might be able to work something else out for you, okay.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Ok, that's fine.;;;
internal: Awesome, I will get back to you by the end of the day and I really appreciate you taking the time to answer my call and I'm sorry again. I couldn't call yesterday.;;;
external: No, that's fine. And I haven't actually received the refund from optic on, that's still like pending. I've been pressing up a couple of payments. No one responded so.;;;
external: Is that something has should only been with them or?;;;
internal: Go ahead.;;;
internal: Yeah, unfortunately, we can't put any pressure on them with that one mm.;;;
external: I can send it.;;;
internal: Yeah, I'll see if I can get any advice to give you in regards to that but we don't, we can't chase up the refund for you. but I might be able to get some some advice for you in that regard as well, okay.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Okay, got it, no problem.;;;

internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Yes, to get the Internet action. This needs to get activated the service. There is connected to the Internet. So it will take some time because it's a processed to get existing contact number to basically existing service to us. So it normally takes about, uh.;;;

external: Sorry, what, what time?;;;
external: The last, but you said.;;;
internal: From that.;;;
internal: So you have the activation date on the twenty eighth, okay, from that day onwards. it will take at least ten to fifteen days for the fourteen to start.;;;

external: Oh, so it's still.;;;
internal: Yeah, is that.;;;
external: Oh, that's, that's not, that's not gonna work either. alright. look just cancel it. It'll be easier that I, I initiate the request next month, um, because I thought that it would, it would be completed on the twenty eighth, but if you're starting on the twenty eighth.;;;

external: You know, it's got helpful, you've got the lights, it's square.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
external: And it's it's square edges, it's not a rounded s.;;;
internal: It's, it doesn't have round digs.;;;
external: No.;;;
internal: I see so the T G seven eight nine, actually has around, I has round digits and, uh.;;;
internal: And there are like tiny holes on top.;;;
external: Yes, it's got a like a G on top.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: But this has got edges on this so.;;;
internal: So when you get to the log in page, does it come up with, uh, uh, Orange buttons to cancel and sign in?;;;
external: I.;;;
internal: The buttons are they, no, are they orange in colour?;;;
external: You mean on on the, em.;;;
internal: The sign in page where you.;;;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: Entered admin and admin.;;;
external: Okay, I'm in the bedroom going back to the garage.;;;
external: Yeah, the Orange box.;;;
internal: I see.;;;
external: Thank.;;;
internal: Alright Terence, are you doing this on, uh, your computer or your mobile?;;;
external: My computer.;;;
internal: Alright, so what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna send you a link there to this is actually an application that we have developed called I and it, let's see you share a live video and then I can guide you step by step. Can we give it a try?;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Yes, that sounds good monkey C monkey, do, huh.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: But I have to tell you Terence, we actually not professionally trained on third party modems but I'm going to certainly try and.;;;
external: Okay, anything to get this guy.;;;
internal: Yes, if not, you would actually have to check with the previous provider to see if the modem is locked by any chance.;;;
external: Well, I've always, it's always been it. I've been a customer for five years now.;;;
internal: Yes, because some service providers, they actually lock their modems to their service. So when you, uh, move on to another provider, you have to actually request them to unlock the modem for you. So let's just hope that it's not one of those instances.;;;
external: I.;;;
internal: Uh, yeah.;;;
external: Yes.;;;
external: So I'm talking to extra at the moment.;;;
internal: Yes, yes Terra, you are with.;;;
external: Yeah, that's what I've got five years I painted.;;;
internal: Yes, so I can see that you were with us since twenty eighteen. Were you using the same modem?;;;
external: Same modem here.;;;
internal: I see.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
internal: Alright, so I've just sent you a text terra to your mobile with a link.;;;
external: Okay, let me have a look.;;;
external: Yeah, I'll see the link.;;;
internal: Yes, you click on the link and then it will give you the option to share a live video.;;;
external: Okay, I've done just loading up.;;;
external: Welcome to the X web portal.;;;
external: I got to the line video.;;;
internal: Yes, click on Live video.;;;
external: Says go back.;;;
external: It says off.;;;
internal: There should be an option to choose allowed.;;;
external: It's also allow, yes, I can, I allow there we are.;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
external: I've got a message from Samsung Internet to.;;;
external: Uh, to take pictures and record video while using the app, is it?;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
internal: Yes, yes, that's what actually lets us. Let me see the live video from my end.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Alright, I am going to accept it from my end now.;;;
external: But it.;;;
external: It's got, it's given me a key number which has got now.;;;
internal: Yes, that's fine. I've got the key. alright. yes, I can see your laptop now, alrighty. so this is the sign in page that's right.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: So according to, uh, what I found on the set up guide, it is actually admin an admin, but you.;;;
internal: Hmm, is it the same, that's at the back of the Iinet modem?;;;
external: Yes, it is, it's a admin admin, it is, yes.;;;
internal: Terrace.;;;
internal: Alright, so if that is the case, would you happen to remember the last time that you had to do this? This was, I'm sure this was a long time ago when you were the last, uh, address, uh, because some modems when you enter the default user name and the password which is admin address.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Admin, it prompts you to change the password.;;;
internal: Would you happen to remember if you changed the password?;;;
external: Well, if it shall I, I, I can't be sure because my son did it, but I could, I know what password is written down here, I could use it.;;;
internal: Yes, but it's not the one. we sent you not this, uh, username.;;;
external: No, no, it's my password.;;;
internal: Alright, you could give it a try.;;;
external: I'll try that hang on.;;;
external: I got to sign in.;;;
internal: Let's see if it works.;;;
internal: Invalid username or password I see.;;;
internal: So, uh, so if that is the case we would have to do a factory reset on the modem Terrance.;;;
external: Like a.;;;
internal: Uh, yes, so can we go back to the modem? You might need a pin, you might need a paper clip or because there is a tiny pin hole at the back of the modem which we need to insert a pin on.;;;
external: Wife.;;;
external: Yeah, okay.;;;
internal: Grab a pin.;;;
external: Okay, okay, just.;;;
external: Paper C.;;;
external: Okay, I'll set up.;;;
internal: Yes, so at the back where all the cables I lost the issue but, uh, that's fine, uh.;;;
external: I've lock room.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: You might have to go to the link, but do you see a reset Pinole Terrace?;;;
external: Would it be on the, at the back?;;;
internal: It's yes, it will be at the back where the cable or the cables are.;;;
external: Yes, I.;;;
external: I'll see it.;;;
internal: Yes, so you, you can insert the pin, hold it down for a few seconds and then you notice all the lights going off the power light might stay on, but the rest would go off.;;;
internal: After that you can take the pin out.;;;
external: That maybe I not in the right now.;;;
external: Yeah, she's, she's resetting.;;;
internal: Yes, the reset, not the power button or the Wifi button, it's the reset its, a pin hole.;;;
external: Okay, well.;;;
external: Ok, just the power, just the power light has stayed on.;;;
internal: Alright, you can take the pin out.;;;
external: Okay on all like.;;;
internal: Yes, uh.;;;
internal: So while you are there, you can actually double check the default user name and the password whether they are both admin and admin.;;;
external: Username admin, password admin.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
internal: Alright and they are all lower case, yeah.;;;
external: All lower cases.;;;
internal: Alright, so once the lights are back on, let's go back to your computer.;;;
internal: And, uh, put in admin and admin again because the reason we did the reset is if the password had to be changed, last time manually. This would reset that and set it to the default credentials so.;;;
external: Yeah, okay. So I'm actually, I'm still in the bedroom and it's just the status light, the power light that's flashing on and off the light doesn't come on.;;;
internal: Alright, em, let's see.;;;
internal: This could take about two to three minutes but, uh, is the Wifi light on, Do you have a Wifi light on this?;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: I've got a wire, that's not on the none of the green lights are on.;;;
internal: Alright, can we, can you share the video once again, Can you go back to the link?;;;
external: Ok, let's do that.;;;
internal: Alright, I have received the request im going.;;;
internal: Alright, yes, I can see that now so the van light and the other lights will come on the wireless light should be on.;;;
internal: Not, so if it takes a bit longer.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Yeah, you didn't remove any of the cables, right, Terra.;;;
external: So all the cables are the there.;;;
internal: Plug.;;;
internal: That's right, is it tightly fied in ye?;;;
external: There is a reset button at the back as well, if maybe you could do that.;;;
internal: Hmm, that would be the power button, I believe it.;;;
external: Yes, but but it it, I often s do this sort of stuff, sit often starting.;;;
internal: There anyway, this should come up in a bit. It seems like it's taking a bit longer.;;;
external: Hi here, we got this wireless, is there?;;;
internal: Yes and, uh.;;;
internal: At the moment, the van light will come on as well, but that's fine as long as we have the, uh.;;;
internal: Wireless light, we can go back to your laptop.;;;
external: Okay, bye, bye.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
internal: Alright, let's refresh the page and it seems like you've disconnected from the Wifi, so let's connect you back to the Wifi.;;;
internal: You see the tiny globe down there onto your right?;;;
internal: Where you connect to the Wifi?;;;
external: Well on the computer.;;;
internal: Yes, on the computer, you are currently disconnected so you have to.;;;
internal: Yes, click on that the one that says yea, that is the one.;;;
external: Oh, okay, yeah.;;;
internal: And we will once again have to connect to the Iinet modem.;;;
external: Enter the network security key.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Uh, the default Wifi password that's, uh, did you have?;;;
external: Yes, I've got that. I've got that person down, I think somewhere.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
external: Can I put that in?;;;
internal: Yes, you can put that in.;;;
external: Six.;;;
external: Verifying and connecting.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
internal: It will say connected without Internet or connected but no Internet.;;;
external: It's, it's just, I, it here, we go.;;;
external: Your Internet connection is currently down, you can try the following.;;;
internal: Can you show me what it shows?;;;
external: Can you see on the screen?;;;
internal: Hmm, I can see you Terra, I think you've flipped the camera.;;;
external: What.;;;
external: Oh, sorry, what happen do do.;;;
internal: Yes, uh, can you show me the Wifi status once again on whether you are connected to the Wifi where you had the globe before?;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: No Internet secured.;;;
internal: I'm seeing you once again terrace.;;;
external: Oh, shit, that's going.;;;
external: Oh, what's going on.;;;
external: Oh, oh, I must this way, is that what?;;;
internal: Alright, yes, there you go, yeah.;;;
external: Worry about it.;;;
internal: There, you go, let me see.;;;
internal: Yes, no Internet secured, that's correct now. uh, what does it say on the screen, uh?;;;
internal: Sure.;;;
internal: Oh.;;;
internal: Yes restart.;;;
external: Is the Internet connection is currently down, you can try to following check that your Ethernet cable is firmly connected to the correct port on your gateway.;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
external: Or the Internet socket in the wall?;;;
internal: Yes, we are trying the second one, we are restarting the gateway. so you could put in the same address that you put in before.;;;
external: Without I put that in.;;;
internal: Eh, to get to the sign in page to the log in page before.;;;
external: Uh, well, I'm not too sure how to do that. it doesn't take, it doesn't give me any button button here.;;;
internal: Hmm, you could click on refresh on the browser on the top left.;;;
internal: You see the refresh button.;;;
internal: Just under that.;;;
external: It's log in.;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
internal: Uh, the one next to it.;;;
internal: That's back, uh.;;;
internal: The one before that the one that looks like, yes, that's the one.;;;
external: Reload the page, ok.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Sky.;;;
internal: Comes up with the same one, Can we go to the other tab terrace, the first step where you had log in?;;;
internal: So.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Yea, that is the one.;;;
internal: Yes, let's.;;;
external: Oh, there we go.;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
internal: Let's refresh this page first.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
internal: Yep and then.;;;
internal: Yes now let's put in admin and admin.;;;
external: And sign in.;;;
external: Vey.;;;
internal: This looks promising.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Um.;;;
internal: Alright, it seems like we've disconnected from the Wifi once again. Can you see, uh, below where you had the globe?;;;
internal: Let's see if it, alright. it actually did come up alright, that's fine, that's fine. We could just leave it as it is.;;;
internal: And then go back.;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
internal: What do we see, can you show me what it shows?;;;
internal: Set up with it.;;;
external: Now got.;;;
external: Is it?;;;
internal: Brilliant, so on the Internet service provider, click on the drop down arrow.;;;
internal: It's not iinet, you need to select other.;;;
internal: Do you see other?;;;
internal: I cannot see the screen.;;;
external: Is not.;;;
external: It says there there is not other.;;;
internal: Let's see.;;;
internal: What.;;;
external: I, I net, I, I, there's only four options iinet West Net Transac, Adam Internet en mode.;;;
internal: I see.;;;
internal: That's gonna be a problem but you said that you used the same modem at the last location, yeah.;;;
external: Yes, yes, I've been using it from the start five years ago. I've never changed it, the original one.;;;
internal: I see.;;;
internal: I see alright, so let's go ahead with Iinet. You don't happen to remember which option you took right because normally on other modems, you get the other option.;;;
external: Ah, yeah.;;;
internal: Alright, that's fine, uh.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Let's go ahead with Iinet and see and, uh, when interfaces its Ethernet, yes, that's correct.;;;
internal: And when type should be changed.;;;
internal: P p p over eat, yep, that's right.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: And this is where you enter the username and the password we sent to you, uh, Terence.;;;
external: Okay, well, it's, it's offering me this one, this drop down which is.;;;
internal: Let me check that could be the old one.;;;
external: That's the, that's the original one.;;;
internal: Yes, that's not the one you need to enter.;;;
external: No, I must.;;;
internal: Do you want me to send you the text once again?;;;
external: Now I've got it written down, so I can, uh.;;;
external: Put that one in there and just changed a couple of numbers that were change also.;;;
internal: Yes, that's right.;;;
external: O seven o seven nine one eight.;;;
external: Now.;;;
external: Seven one eight, eh.;;;
external: One three nine one four.;;;
external: Excellent, okay, that try just check what one eight one four, yeah. And then the password, I put in the one, they gave me.;;;
internal: Yes, the one that starts with an upper case E for elephant.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yes, that's right.;;;
external: And then it goes D H.;;;
external: And then the next digit is either a capital o or a zero. I think it's zero.;;;
internal: It's, it's actually a zero, it's actually a zero.;;;
external: Right, I thanks and then a N G A.;;;
internal: N G A, that's correct.;;;
external: Okay, I got that go to next.;;;
external: And then we go to step two which is v P net, I don't have Vp. so I just go next.;;;
internal: Let me check, yes, that's right.;;;
external: A Vip.;;;
external: Now we're at step three for the Wifi setup, the wifi's on and the S S I D broadcast is on.;;;
internal: Alright, yes, that's fine.;;;
internal: And that's your Wifi name, yes, that's fine, click on next.;;;
external: Oh, jeez again.;;;
external: Come back.;;;
external: We didn't go away.;;;
internal: Yeah, that's I was thinking.;;;
internal: See.;;;
internal: Let me see, I'm going to see if I could.;;;
internal: Yeah, so the setup wasn't complete.;;;
internal: Can we go back to, uh, the set up is, I think it's at the top.;;;
internal: Hmm, no on on the main screen when you scroll up a bit, you see two buttons onto your top, right?;;;
external: Thank.;;;
internal: Yeah, there you go.;;;
external: Oh, yeah, set up, yeah, yeah.;;;
internal: I think we'll have to go from scratch because we can apply the settings for some reason.;;;
external: Ok, well, we happy with Iinet as a service provider.;;;
internal: Yes, we could use that. since there is no other option.;;;
external: We have to.;;;
external: Eh, we happy with Internet as the one interface.;;;
internal: Yes, when type should be pp over Internet.;;;
external: And we happy with pp over Internet.;;;
external: I've put the username in.;;;
external: When that came on the email.;;;
internal: The what?;;;
internal: Yes, the one that ends with nine one four, I can see that it is already there.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Let's see, oh, seven, oh, one eight.;;;
internal: Yes, that's right. and, uh, let's put in the password once again Terence.;;;
external: Right that temper shift E.;;;
external: D A K.;;;
external: Zero.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Yeah, I think.;;;
external: I dont have Vip work can go next.;;;
internal: Yes, I think you can click on, I don't have a Vip button there.;;;
external: Then we go next.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: That's all good.;;;
internal: That's the five G I believe.;;;
internal: The two point four alright, click on next.;;;
internal: Oh, it just goes away.;;;
external: Yeah, it's the second time, it's done it.;;;
internal: That's strange.;;;
external: I don't that that.;;;
internal: Um.;;;
internal: Let's see.;;;
internal: Still hasn't authenticated the modem hasn't been configured yet. I'm not sure what's causing this. It could be an issue on the modem too, but you said that you were using the same modem previously.;;;
external: Yes, yes on Friday. I used it. I used it quite, you know, caught up on everything. I did quite a bit on it and then it just switched off.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
internal: Uh, um.;;;
external: Just switched it off and brought it up, yeah.;;;
internal: I see.;;;
internal: Mm.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Strange, why it doesn't, uh.;;;
internal: Let you, em.;;;
internal: Configure the modem.;;;
internal: See, uh.;;;
internal: Mm.;;;
internal: It seems like there is an issue with the configuration Terence and, uh.;;;
internal: It would actually be a lot easier because I mean this modem. I mean did you buy this modem before you joined us Terrace.;;;
external: This modem.;;;
external: Uh.;;;
external: I can't remember what, what do you mean I buy it.;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
internal: Hmm, so did you get this when you were with Iinet, I mean before you joined Exeter.;;;
external: Um.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yes, yes, I right from the beginning five years. This is the only equipment I've had.;;;
internal: Alright, so this Iinet modem was not provided by exit right.;;;
external: And, uh.;;;
external: My son set it up for me five years ago. I can't remember how it came about that.;;;
internal: I see so.;;;
external: But he he also uses ex hotels, He's got several, uh, systems.;;;
internal: I see alright. so this modem was actually not sent out by us. but, uh, so the reason is Terence. We, I'm not sure what the exact issue is but I can see that it's a matter of just applying the settings, but it wouldn't let you apply the settings.;;;
external: Uh, as you see all step for.;;;
internal: So.;;;
internal: Yeah, yeah, that's right, so it.;;;
internal: Yeah, it could be an issue with the modem so, uh.;;;
internal: Uh, what I could do from my end is since I actually do not have access to your modem remotely. What I could do is if you're happy to go ahead. I could, I mean we send out a new modem, uh, it's actually a brand new modem and, uh, I could actually check with a management to arrange a fifty.;;;
internal: There was a discount on it. If you're happy to go ahead because from my end. I cannot, this is actually the best, we can do to configure a third party modem.;;;
external: Uh, huh, what would that cost?;;;
internal: Um.;;;
internal: Eh, so the original cost is a hundred and forty dollars, so fifty percent off that would be seventy dollars.;;;
external: Uh.;;;
internal: Can I arrange that?;;;
external: Pretty.;;;
external: Pretty heavy, isn't it, um?;;;
external: What?;;;
external: Change not have to do that, uh.;;;
external: But if you feel like anyway around it then I'll have to do it. I'm forced to do it it I.;;;
internal: Eh, so.;;;
internal: Uh, the, the modem we send, you is basically just plug in place. so the modem is pre configured. so it's basically just plug and play which is why we normally suggest unless I mean if there is an issue on third party modems we cannot actually remotely log into it since we do not have access to it.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Hmm, so if you're happy to go ahead.;;;
external: Alright, thank.;;;
external: I think, yes, I think you know, say makes sense to me. so I think we're gonna have to do that, yes.;;;
internal: I could.;;;
internal: Yes, because this modem is actually an old modem that is no longer with Iinet. I mean even Iinet does not send out this modem anymore. And it is possible that the modem has degraded over time. So it seems like it is a modem issue, but I can certainly.;;;
external: Uh, huh.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Check with a management to get a fifty percent discount if you're happy to go ahead with that, uh, clearance.;;;
external: Yeah, yeah, yes please.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
external: Oh.;;;
external: So how long is that gonna take?;;;
internal: Yes so.;;;
internal: Uh, that to be honest, let me check. it normally takes about three to five days to be honest to be.;;;
external: Oh shit, yeah.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: And.;;;
internal: Would you happen to have an alternative modem with you maybe with your son or something that you could use for now or?;;;
external: That I, I don't know, I'd have to ask him if he's got anything.;;;
external: Um.;;;
internal: I see.;;;
internal: Because it's just a matter of applying the settings on the modem which we actually unable to do from our end.;;;
internal: The settings have to be applied on your end, but it wouldn't let you apply the settings for some reason.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: So whatever modem I, I substitute this one with I still use those thing to username and password numbers.;;;
internal: Yes, so if you, if you want to go ahead with another third party modem, you could do the same login to the modem like you did now And then it's just a matter of putting in the username and the password, we sent you, that's what actually connects the modem with Tex Internet so.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Ok.;;;
external: Alright, well, I think we have actually have an alternative. I must go ahead with what you suggesting.;;;
internal: Yes, you could try that too and just make sure that it's an unlocked modem, uh.;;;
external: Well, I'm gonna only use the one you send me.;;;
internal: Alright, alright. so can I arrange that?;;;
external: Give us a couple of days.;;;
external: Please do that, yes.;;;
internal: Alright and do you want?;;;
external: Probably the long run is probably going to be the best thing.;;;
internal: Yes and you want the delivery address to be the same address, yeah, you need fifty six slash, alright. I'm gonna arrange.;;;
external: Yes please, yeah.;;;
external: Sorry, what number fifty six at fifty four road?;;;
internal: Yes, that's the one. yes. I'm gonna arrange that for you and once I get the confirmation from our management, I will get back to you personally and after placing the order for the modem, alright.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Right, thank you.;;;
internal: Alright, I'm sorry that we couldn't.;;;
external: Is that it?;;;
external: Who, who, who will contact me for the, the billing?;;;
internal: Uh, the billing will be, uh, automatically I mean you will be automatically billed, but fifty percent would be waived off from that so you will be charged seventy dollars.;;;
external: Just on my account.;;;
internal: Yes, that will be on the account.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Yeah, that's fine, That's good.;;;
internal: Alright, I'm sorry, we couldn't fix this over the phone but I'm, I'm gonna get this. I mean I'm sure I mean the new modem should work with this since it's preconfigured. It's basically just plug and play. So you just got to remove that yellow cable from the modem and plug it to the same.;;;
external: Well.;;;
internal: On the brand new modem, alright Terence.;;;
external: Okay and it should go, okay.;;;
external: Thanks thanks for Persevering. Thanks for your support.;;;
internal: Thank you very much. Che, alright. You have a good day Cheri.;;;
external: Thank you very much.;;;

external: Exactly.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Thank you for holding apologize for the wait, hello.;;;
external: Yeah, hi.;;;
internal: Hi Sam. so I did some quick remote testing and I went through the previous cases as well. I'm sure sorry for the inconvenience so since you are using exit provided modems. I will be able to remotely log into the modem and check on it configuration to see if there are any issues with that as well, Is it okay if I try to log into the modem remotely?;;;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
external: Yeah, so just so you know the two point four g, we can connect to two point five, nothing like we can connect not working at all.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Not working at all, ok.;;;
external: And they are both flashing on the modem.;;;
internal: Okay, uh, so let me log into the modem and would you be able to, let me know the back address of the modem, it should be in the back of the modem.;;;
external: Yeah, once.;;;
internal: Sure.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
external: So what did you wanna know?;;;
internal: Uh, in the back of the modem, there is a sticker in that sticker, there should be something called Mac.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah, okay, so it's seven four.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: Six F.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
external: Eight eight.;;;
external: C B.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
external: S S.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: C.;;;
internal: Okay. Thank you for that and can you please? let me know is this started recently, did it started recently or or?;;;
external: Well, we had an outage on Monday and Tuesday and it came back online yesterday ago and since then it's been it's been slow.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Okay, okay, what about the distance between the devices and the modem so usually five day is not suitable for longer ranges. so it is not a long range. so it is probably since you are a shop.;;;
external: Well, it's, it's not far and we have an extender anyway so.;;;
internal: Not far.;;;
internal: Okay, you have extended.;;;
external: It shouldn't matter and before the outage it was all working fine.;;;
internal: Okay, so the thing is, so this can be the thing is there's a possibility, uh, after the outage, the modem needs to be reconfigure modem has been affected by the outage or something like that. The thing is that the extend that you?;;;
external: Mm.;;;
internal: Uh, you're using, is it an exit one or is it a third party because I'm not detecting extender third party?;;;
external: Third third party, but we're third party, we're not, we're not connecting to network connecting directly to the.;;;
internal: Wifi modem, okay. In that case so I went through the case history as well. Uh, I would like to suggest a factory is to the modem because they can be issued with the modem configuration that happens because of the outage. so we can, we can do a factories to the modem.;;;
external: Hmm Wifi.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: And then, uh, we will be able to check to check to see if most of the times, these type of issues can be resolved by a quick factory reset, but I need to let you know Sam since you are you guys are running a business? I need to let you know if you guys have done any customized changes to the modem as an example if you guys change.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Your Wifi names, Wifi passwords or unique.;;;
external: No, it's all. it's all just based off what it was.;;;
internal: Okay, so that means so usually do you, do you have a security system configure to the modem anything a C cctv or something like that or any port forward?;;;
external: Uh, yea, we do.;;;
internal: Uh, huh, that's the thing is if you have done the done, those specific configurations to the modem. you might need to, you need to reconfigure the modem again And I'm not, I won't be able to help you out with that. So that's why I need to confirm.;;;
external: Today.;;;
external: Is connecting to the Wifi that is it?;;;
internal: Disconnecting to the Wifi, ok, then you will be able to reconnect it through the Wifi.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Ok, so what is the device on the land one, is that you are extended?;;;
external: It's just a, eh, it's just a desktop.;;;
internal: Next, okay, okay. In that case I think we are good to go. So let's do a hard reset to the model. So in order to do this reset you will be able to see in the top of the modem. there is a small hale. So you need to get a pay for a pin place it inside the hall and press it down for eight to ten seconds.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: And you will be able to see all the lights in the modem, they will go off.;;;
external: Okay, one sec.;;;
internal: Sure, take your time.;;;
external: Ten seconds as you said.;;;
internal: Yeah, eight to ten seconds, all the lights will go off, only the power light will stay on, okay.;;;
external: Hello.;;;
internal: Yeah, I'm here.;;;
external: Yeah so.;;;
external: Now.;;;
internal: Yeah, yeah, you can do it just checking the checking on the modem right now. I think it's, I think you just, did it did the light went off.;;;
external: Yeah, yeah, so just the power light on.;;;
internal: Okay, then you can let it go then I just gonna check it right now still offline for me, might take a minute to come online.;;;
internal: Oh the lights.;;;
external: By.;;;
external: Hi there, they coming back on there.;;;
external: The two point four is back on.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;

internal: I can see devices are already connected. I can see like one two.;;;
internal: Three four devices connected with the Mac. I think there's a Mac also connected.;;;
external: It looks like it's working but it's still not that far.;;;
internal: Ok, so can you please check, let me know the diss between your modem and, uh, and and the devices that you are using because I think.;;;
external: I am standing right next to it on my phone.;;;
internal: Right next to it, okay. so let's run a speed test then so in your phone, is it connected to the two point four G or to the five G?;;;
external: Five five J.;;;
internal: Five G, ok, open up a browser, uh, type in exit speed test and can you run a speed test and let me know the speeds that you are receiving.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: What we are doing now.;;;
external: So it says hundred megabytes.;;;

external: A test, hmm. because of I'm having sort of slow slow Internet speed.;;;
external: And anyway the phone got disconnected and I didn't end up getting to do it. So I was just wondering if you could talk me through how so I done like I'm connected directly to the optic box via Ppoe and I can do Internet speed test that's fine. I'm getting about two hundred and seventy.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Megabytes per second there, but he said there was a way we could test the direct line to see if I was, you know able to get a Gigabyte speed.;;;
internal: Ok, could I have your customer Id number so that I can look into that sir?;;;
external: Uh, I don't know my Id number, hmm.;;;
internal: Your mobile number would be fine, yeah.;;;

internal: Alright and could you confirm me your full name, uh?;;;
external: Yeah, Curtis Jackson.;;;
internal: Yeah and email address along with your service address, uh, your full service address.;;;
external: Email address is k Jack at gmail dot com and the address is nine Cramp Street.;;;
internal: And along with the state and the post code sir.;;;
external: Post code two two eight four.;;;
internal: Alright and you would receive all right, the authentication quote was already verified, so that's fine.;;;
internal: Let me check on this. So you said you are connected directly to the optical device, right?;;;
external: Yes, correct.;;;
external: And so I just did a speed test on the, actually to.;;;
external: Website then and I get two hundred and seventy two megabytes.;;;
internal: Two hundred and seventy two megabytes, alright.;;;
external: Em, but I signed up for the.;;;
external: The one gigabyte link, um.;;;
external: Yeah, the last guy, I was talking to said I could do it direct.;;;
external: Test to find out, you know, the, the true speed I could get.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: Alright, mm, can you check whether the cable that you're using? it should be printed on the cable, whether it's a cat five E or a cat six cable?;;;
external: Ah, yeah, pretty sure, let me check, mm.;;;
external: It doesn't actually have it printed on here.;;;
external: Hmm, I can.;;;
external: And I've definitely got.;;;
external: A cat cable, I can swap it out just in case.;;;
internal: Oh, yeah, let's just sort it out and then run a speed test because sometimes cables can have limitations as well.;;;
external: That is it.;;;
internal: So, uh, and before use swap the cables just restart the device, the optum device also.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah, sure on, yeah.;;;
external: Okay, do that now.;;;
external: Bye.;;;
external: It's booting back up now.;;;
internal: Is the optimum device back on?;;;
external: Yeah, I'm on devices back on, I'm just trying to.;;;
external: Think it's up. I'm just trying to log back in to the.;;;
external: P Ppo connection.;;;
external: Waiting for it to come back online, I think.;;;
external: Ok, I'm connected again.;;;
external: I'll run another speed test.;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
external: So same same sort of slightly worse, two hundred and sixty.;;;
external: Megabytes per second.;;;
external: With that table and I know that one.;;;
internal: Oh, okay. let me, I think there was, uh, this was already with optic and were the instructions provided to us.;;;
internal: Since that is also not working out So we will have to get back to optic and tell them that we did the, uh, the strips that they advise us also.;;;
internal: And since there is no improvement. We'll have to raise this with them. C. so as soon as we do have some feedback on that.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: We will be getting back to you, alright.;;;
external: Alright, so I did get feedback from them. I think and they said everything looks fine on their end and then the next step was that a technician would come out.;;1;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Mm, but you know if it's, um.;;;
external: Incorrect call out then it's a two hundred dollar fee or whatever.;;;
internal: Yeah, exactly, yeah, but.;;;
external: So yeah, the last guy said before we arranged for that there was a test. I could do.;;;
external: I have to test the direct.;;;
external: Link speed, not the Internet speed is that is that a thing like?;;;
external: To check what, mm, you know, the actual bandwidth capacity is into my.;;;
external: On the unit.;;;
internal: Uh, so, uh, yeah that I think that would be the test that you just did the direct Ppoe connection.;;;
external: Yeah, so that's, yeah, okay. Well, that's what I told him, I've done and he said no, there's another test but.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Um.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
external: Anyway, I don't know.;;;
internal: If that's the case, yeah, One of our agents will reach out to you and they will advise you on what is going to happen.;;;
internal: All right.;;;
external: Uh.;;;
external: Fine, so yeah, that is the speed I getting to the opt box but then I'm only getting like a hundred and forty to my router.;;;
internal: Hundred and forty to your road and you said the pp direct is about two hundred and sixty six, right.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Yeah, yeah, two sixty two seventy, normally for the direct.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
external: Then hit my router, it's only a hundred and forty, I had the issue with my.;;;
external: Previous provider.;;;
external: Mm, I'll on a two hundred and fifty megabyte, mm connection with them. And I was only getting around a hundred and forty and what they ended up having to do was change my connection from, mm.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Ppo to hmm to a dynamic.;;;
external: Um.;;;
external: So you don't put your username and password in.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: And then all of a sudden that fixed, it was getting like two hundred and fifty Meb bits per second like my router so.;;;
internal: Okay, yeah.;;;
external: I don't know, is there an option with you guys.;;;
internal: I'm sorry, I didn't.;;;
external: Is that an option with you guys, can we change from a?;;;
internal: Hmm, I will have to check that since it's already address with the supplier. Uh, we might have to check that and get back to you with regards to that. So we will be notifying you on what steps can be taken anywhere since we have already raised this.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;

internal: Oh me.;;;
external: We've tried all different options. I actually don't know that the cabling particularly good, that's been done but anyways that.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Bye.;;;
external: I don't think they have come to fix that.;;;
internal: Yeah, so, yeah, alright, no worries. Can I know if?;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: If you tried considering your new router.;;;
external: Yeah, tried that about five times last night and then there was no because you were only open til five, I couldn't speak to anybody.;;;
internal: Alright, okay. And can I if you like a new log in, I mean the login details for your connection.;;;
internal: Did you put that as or can I know?;;;
external: Uh.;;;
external: Pardon.;;;
internal: So can I know if you put the log in details for your Internet connection on your router?;;;
external: Yeah, how do I do that then?;;;
internal: Alright, okay. so first of all, I'll just send you a link to your mobile center.;;;
internal: So just a second, let me.;;;
internal: So I can check as how it is corrected that I could.;;;
internal: China, can you press on the Lib video option?;;;
external: Yeah, it's opened.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
external: What do you need me to press my video?;;;
internal: Yeah, live with you.;;;
internal: You pending off.;;;
internal: Just a sec.;;;
internal: Yeah, I can see it, you know, so I know the black adapter is.;;;
internal: Which is connected to the dish, alright. Can just make it more closer, uh.;;;
internal: Can I know what colour is, is it in white or is it in?;;;
external: What.;;;
external: Do you mean, hmm, double light on it?;;;
internal: Yeah, the light on it.;;;
external: Yes, it's white.;;;
internal: So that is like connecting to your dish right on your.;;;
external: Yeah, I believe so.;;;
internal: I like to get.;;;
external: I think that I've changed all the cables. So at the moment, there's the yellow one, there was a blue one last night, but the problem is when this has been put in, it goes into the wall. If you're not careful, you have to be really really careful. So I'm trying not to move. I try not to touch that cable if I don't have to.;;;
internal: Oh, I do.;;;
external: About.;;;
external: If we need to change the cable, we can do, but hmm, so this is the cable that came with my router. So I've connected that to the land, um, but originally we had this cable connected into here which was connected to the lance and then our router.;;;
internal: Oh.;;;
external: Within another room with a cable that comes out of the wall to connect but I can't get it. I've tried both options and none of it works.;;;
internal: Yeah, I previously, how was your Internet connected to, was it connected to this wall socket?;;;
external: How long has it been like that since we've been with you?;;;
internal: Yeah, no, I'm asking so earlier before you got this modem. Can I know how was your connection connected? was it through the wall or through different socket?;;;
external: Uh, sorry, I don't understand how long.;;;
internal: No, no, to where was it connected the black add up previously.;;;
external: That before it went down this week.;;;
internal: The channel I wanted to know where I was the black adapter, was it connected to?;;;
internal: Was it connected.;;;
external: How old is the?;;;
internal: No, was it collected in the same place even before.;;;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: I mean it is in the, it was connected on the same socket, right?;;;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
internal: Yeah, can I know if I did send you any lock in details for your email or mobile?;;;
external: Uh, yes, except I don't know where I'm supposed to put them in cause when I go through the step by step guide on the app. It doesn't give me that option.;;;
internal: So when I'm going on the app and I know it should like to have the bpp or your option.;;;
external: Sorry.;;;
internal: Can I know on the app if it gives a triple bpo, o app option.;;;
external: So I've got to reset up again cause I couldn't set it up last night so because it kept reaching and then said you've got no Internet, em, uh, try this one. Let me see it says detecting Internet connection type.;;;
internal: Yeah, can you select on that? Can you know what options do you have?;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Eh, it says.;;;
external: Okay, um, Internet connection p p P O E.;;;
internal: Yeah, can you select that check?;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: I've got.;;;
internal: Four.;;;
external: Should it be p P P O E or should it be, I'm guessing, it's got to be P P P O E because of the P O E, but I don't know.;;;
internal: So there is, yeah, Can you just read the options that is available there?;;;
external: Static I P L two T P P P T P D S light.;;;
internal: Alright, okay, can just select on triple p p o e, so it's P P or yeah, just select on that.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: The username is that where I put my new scope.;;;
internal: The.;;;
external: N.;;;
internal: Yes, yeah, yeah, the user name and the pass has to go in there.;;;
external: Ok.;;;
external: It didn't come up at all last night like I didn't have, um, and it's new dot com, is it dot com or dot com dot a u?;;;
internal: Its just dot com.;;;
external: Yeah, okay and then put my password in.;;;
external: Yeah, okay, right optional settings.;;;
internal: Well, I'm sorry, yeah, just a sec, it comes with so on the email. Can you check if it's with dot com dot a u or is it just dot com? So unfortunately we cannot see it from my end that is.;;;
external: Uh, let me see if there's any way I might be able to find out if somebody spoke to me about. I've just written it down it's the other pulled off.;;;
internal: Yeah, so actually your account user name is with dot a U, so I just want to double check if your user name also.;;;
external: Oh, yeah.;;;
internal: Has a.;;;
external: Ok, I dot a U O.;;;
internal: Uh, yeah, can I just check your email or the Sms that you received it with a or?;;;
external: Yeah, I've got Shantel at new s dot com dot a U.;;;
internal: Alright, yeah, then you can put on there as well.;;;
external: Yeah, ok, then I've got the password and then it says optional settings.;;;
external: Em.;;;
internal: And yeah, just, yeah, just make sure that you are putting the proper password. I mean the upper case and lower case as it is on the email or Sms, yeah.;;;
external: I seen.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: So do I need to do anything with optional settings?;;;
internal: Uh, no, you can leave as a default and you can continue I mean.;;;
external: Okay and then it's got I P Tv forward slash v, la settings that's off. I think that's supposed to be off.;;;
internal: Just leave it as a default or channel that should be fine, yeah.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Alright, we'll go next.;;;
internal: Yeah, so the only option, yep. the only thing is, you will have to change it to Triple Ppoe and enter your, uh, log in details there, that's it.;;;
external: Alright.;;;
external: Yeah, okay. Let's, let's see if this works because that didn't come up last night which is really strange because I did it that many times.;;;
external: To not have got half that bit, hmm.;;;
internal: It off.;;;
external: I can't remember what that one is.;;;
external: Okay, hopefully this works now then.;;;
internal: Cool.;;;
external: But yeah, none of that option came up last night which is so strange because I know I was given and I thought where am I supposed to put that bit in.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Yeah, so did you so last time? Did you select the triple option or did you select any other options?;;;
external: I didn't get that. it didn't get the option to pull that up.;;;
external: This is really strange.;;;
internal: Yeah, usually that is usually if you select the triple P option, it comes up.;;;
internal: Username and the password.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Oh, I think.;;;
external: I may be connected, gosh.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Maybe it's green and it hasn't been green before so maybe that's a good s.;;;
internal: Oh.;;;
external: Not pressing it, okay. sorry, I feel like this has been such a pain, the last day.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Em, oh, ok, so it's now set up not shit.;;;
external: Okay, everything looks good. So alright. I think I'll have to, let me see if I can turn my hotspot off because that's what.;;;
external: Um.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
external: Let me have a look.;;;
external: And it's not, so Wifi settings.;;;
external: Yeah, ok.;;;
external: Right.;;;
external: But it's still not connecting to the.;;;
external: Maybe it's because it's still checking.;;;
external: Um.;;;
external: Do you think it could be that, it will take a while for my Wifi to set up.;;;
internal: Yeah, uh, maximum. it will take like five to ten minutes maximum. I don't think it will take more than that.;;;
external: Okay, no worries. So the fact that the, the router's connected.;;;
external: Em, I do have a question for you, hmm.;;;
internal: Yeah, sure.;;;
external: There is a way because at the moment, em, obviously there's a username and password, em, how do we, em?;;;
external: We stop others from going on because the username and password, so I think that's all we need to do, isn't it.;;;
internal: Sorry, I wouldn't get you.;;;
external: That's okay, don't worry, em.;;;
external: Alright, so I think it's still doing something.;;;
external: Uh, living room.;;;
external: Wifi settings, one online client.;;;
external: Um.;;;
external: It says it's got my phone but I haven't got a, um.;;;
external: I haven't, it doesn't show that it.;;;
external: Might be alright, okay. I'll have a play around with it. But if I, you're there til five today, aren't you?;;;
external: Hello.;;;
internal: Hello, yeah. Can you hear me, yeah, yeah, yeah.;;;

external: Ye should, I be able to, um, it doesn't say I've got any download or upload speeds on it.;;;
external: Does that mean it's working or not working?;;;
internal: No, so actually no, so can I know we are checking this download option is it on the website or is it like checking through the app.;;;
external: Oh.;;;
external: It's through the app.;;;
internal: Yeah, so first of all you will have to get your Internet connected and then you will be able to check your speeds.;;;
external: Yeah, so it's saying it is connected, that's all so ok.;;;
external: It's got, hmm.;;;
external: It's got my phone online, mm and it's got zero K B P S and zero k p p s up or down like zero both ways.;;;

internal: I'm in the router.;;;
external: Sorry, what do you need? So if it doesn't work restart it.;;;
internal: Yeah, restarted and just just keep it for a few more minutes and check and if it still doesn't work, we can just try putting the lock in details again and check if it's working.;;;
external: Okay, yeah, alright, okay. We'll get her to go. Thank you for your help.;;;

internal: Uh, it's not exactly password problem. I'm actually detecting a service issue like a connection issue here. That's why I'm telling you if it was a password issue, I could have sorted it right away.;;;
external: Well, he's, he's telling me that there's nothing wrong with the line.;;;
internal: But.;;;

internal: Alexander.;;;

external: Okay.;;;
internal: This broadband, this broadband light.;;;
internal: Sb has it been doing this.;;;
external: And I.;;;
external: Uh, uh, yeah, it's been doing this.;;;
external: I haven't had that much attention to it to be honest. I think it's usually solid, maybe I can't remember.;;;
internal: No, there is something wrong with your.;;;
internal: Right. So what, what he shows is Alexander right?;;;
internal: It shows that you having an internal wiring issue.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Right, I'll tell you exactly what it says it says performance issue detected.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Right potential line impairment.;;;
internal: And it says, uh.;;;
internal: Potential premises wiring, issue has been detected.;;;
internal: Right.;;;
external: Again.;;;
internal: So what I'll do is.;;;
internal: Uh, so so what you need to do is, you need to fix your internal wiring first.;;;
internal: Because that's why this broadband light doesn't come up right. I think sometimes you might be facing these kinds of issues, right. Give me a second.;;;
external: Alright. so how do I, who do I talk to about that?;;;
internal: Uh, so are you living an apartment then if you apartment, you will have to talk to your, like the owner of the apartment.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: And get it fixed, right.;;;
external: Alright, okay.;;;
internal: So what I'll do is, eh.;;;
internal: Just give me a moment, just give me a moment.;;;
internal: Like.;;;
internal: Anyways, what I'll do is, I'll lodge in a fault with the Mbn as well, right.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: And see what, what is going on so but at the same time, it's better if you can.;;;
internal: Look into this issue as well, just give me a moment, I'll try to log in a fault, okay.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: You sure, the cable is connected properly, right?;;;
external: Yeah, we already.;;;
internal: Can you remove the cable and can you remove the cable from the outlet and fix it back again?;;;
internal: Do you have another cable with you?;;;
external: Now.;;;
external: No, we've had this, we, we have had this issue before to be honest. They told us there was a wiring issue and.;;;
internal: So then before you know to B, it's better if you can fix it from your end.;;;
internal: Because if they do the test and find the same resource.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Then it will be, I think it's better if you can sort out the issue from your end first.;;;
external: Okay, um.;;;
internal: Ok, just just for a, we see what is happening now, right?;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
external: Yeah, there might be.;;;
external: In the, so.;;;
internal: Just give me.;;;
external: Um, it to go to like.;;;
external: The other line.;;;
external: Arrive, it should be a pardon and then he put that he dropped down, then pay password something like that.;;;
external: Yeah, it looks like the same issue like broadband is flashing and not working bi.;;;
internal: Yeah, yeah, more more than a more than a slow speed issue. The slow speed issue has been good that we used even that a slow speed issue. What I can see is because of this internal wiring is that you are getting this issue continuously.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Okay, I'll, I'll speak to my agent.;;;
internal: Yeah, just just give me a moment. I'll try to do from my end.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: See if there are any issues.;;;
internal: Bye.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: Stay stay on line for one minute, I will.;;;
internal: Final Li, yes.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Thank you.;;;
internal: So Alexander, what I can advise on is once you get this internal wiring fixed.;;;

external: Ok y.;;;
external: Okay, so yeah.;;;
external: Do I need to reboot the modem?;;;
internal: It usually takes about three to five minutes but if it does not pick up after that time, we will have to reboot it yet.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: So exit doesn't have a mobile backup.;;;
internal: Unfortunately, no, we don't have a mobile back up. It is just the modem back.;;;
external: Yeah, no, that's okay.;;;
external: Should I be taking that Sim card out of the modem or something like that?;;;
internal: You can do it.;;;
internal: Alright, let's try restarting the.;;;
external: Reboot it.;;;
external: All you can do on that is, is actually disconnected because it doesn't appear to have a.;;;
internal: Okay, oh, yeah, that's fine.;;;
external: What I'm doing.;;;
internal: Yeah, you could just, uh, try switching off the power supply and then turn it back.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Okay, so back in.;;;
internal: Let me know when the lights are back on.;;;
external: Got a white light on the front at the moment, nothing on the back.;;;

internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Uh.;;;
internal: Has the land light come on?;;;
external: No other lights is yet orange on the front now.;;;

external: Bye.;;;
external: Okay, Sim cards, yeah.;;;
internal: Are you, uh, can you see the M b n device?;;;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: Yeah, so all I mean the lights on the M B M device are solid, right.;;;
external: It's two green lights solid, yeah.;;;
internal: Two green lights, uh.;;;
internal: Can you tell me what the lights are?;;;
external: It could be.;;;
external: Em, no power and.;;;
external: It says optical.;;;
internal: That green.;;;
internal: Alright, so, uh, is there a unit one light, uh, maybe?;;;
external: Sorry, what number?;;;
internal: Un one.;;;
external: Not all.;;;
internal: U N I.;;;
internal: Can you check if the cables are connected, right?;;;
external: Well, nothing's been changed.;;;
external: We've got a Wifi light on on the modem now still orange on the front.;;;
internal: Alright, so you're supposed to have three lights on the M b n, so one one would be the power light then the optical light and the other one should be the Uni D light on top. So basically that indicates the connection coming into the modem.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: It is not on.;;;
internal: All right.;;;
external: Maybe the not work.;;;
internal: Em.;;;
internal: That is a possibility, hmm. Could you probably check if your modem is correctly connected through to the w, the Van Port.;;;
internal: And to the M B N device.;;;
internal: It should be connected through to the one port.;;;
external: As I say nothing has been changed down it, it hasn't been touched or moved the year.;;;
external: There's no light on.;;;
external: No, you be one or two or three or four. None of those lights are on.;;;
internal: So I'm running a few tests on M B M, just give me a few minutes, alright.;;;
internal: Alright, hmm. so I checked on Mbn and I ran a few tests from my end. So it seems that the modem is not being detected.;;;
internal: Hmm, that's what they indicate over here. So do you maybe have a spare Internet cable that you would try?;;;
external: Um.;;;
external: I do but.;;;
external: Well, I think I'm going to have to do call you back at some stage. I've really gotta go now, um.;;;
internal: Okay, hmm, uh.;;;
external: But you want me to try another cable at.;;;
internal: Yes, yeah, so Internet cable should go into the one port and to the van port of the modem. just try swapping the cable. I think it should work out because based on the N B N test that I just ran, it says that the modem is not being detected to check whether the Internet cable is connected curve.;;;
internal: Correctly or to change the Internet cable and then test it off.;;;
external: Alright, well, yeah, okay.;;;
internal: Alright, hmm, just just check that out sir. And I think the logins are setting correct. and the settings are correct. Now. It's just that the modem is not, uh, maybe the cables sometimes they can, I mean you may have not moved it around for years. but sometimes they can be faulty after some time, so.;;;
internal: It's best to just for it and just check it out afterwards. if in case the issue persists, you could call us back.;;;
external: Yeah, I'll do that. okay. Then. thank you for your help.;;;

external: Ok.;;;
internal: Mm, at the moment, you are not having that right so.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: So basically you are supposed to have four green lights and if the Internet light is red on the modem that means the configuration is not correct. If the, the solid lights are there on the mbn device, but in this case you do not have two lights which are required.;;;

external: Okay.;;;
external: Yeah, because Internet, this day is very in part of life.;;;

internal: Okay.;;;
internal: Ok.;;;
external: He will have to get a new phone because I think the one that he's got the three g, so that runs out next year doesn't.;;;
internal: Yeah, that's correct, yeah.;;;
external: Um, can he keep the same phone number? He has been with Telstra but when I rang them yesterday because I couldn't recharge, they said they couldn't even find the number. So is there any way of checking whether he could keep that number?;;;
internal: If the number is already cancelled, then you can't actually have that number back. So the porting process happens like if you're transferring over a number to another provider that number has stay active until the process is completed.

external: Right, that's okay. alright. I may have because I don't think I want to change phone numbers that's all, um.;;;

internal: Uh.;;;
external: Um, how does that is that taken out like a direct debit from an account or?;;;
internal: Yeah, that's correct. So we need to give a detail direct debit debit for mobile plans. It has to be a credit card. So you can either give a credit card or the debit card and it will have a monthly bill basically so you can put an auto recharge if you want to, but otherwise it's a monthly cost.;;;
external: Yeah, okay.;;;
external: Right, okay.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: It be basically every month, it'll take the money out.;;;
external: Right, okay and that's the only charges, the sixteen dollars a month.;;;

external: Yes.;;;
external: No not.;;;
external: Yeah, no, no, it doesn't use any data at all. Just just the phone. I guess that's the cheapest price, isn't it that one?;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: Yeah, that's the cheapest one, we have at the moment.;;;
external: Yes.;;;
external: Yeah, alright. and what's involved so if he does want to go ahead if he's happy to change his number, mm, what do you send the Sim out? is that how it works or?;;;
internal: Uh, yeah, yeah. so if the phone if you need a, em, as well, we can do an easy. otherwise, we can send the physical Sim card out.;;;
external: What's an, a, how does that work?;;;
internal: Is more like a bar code where you have to scan for modern phones like new phones. you don't actually need a Sim card. You just have to scan a bar code and it will automatically connect to the network.;;;
external: Oh, what do you scan it with sorry?;;;
internal: Uh, it is through a phone from your phone, you can scan the bar code.;;;
external: Right, so it would have to be from the phone that he's going to use.;;;
internal: Yeah, yeah, yeah, correct.;;;
external: Right, he's only getting like a cheap Nokia flip file. So I'm not sure whether.;;;
internal: It didn't need phone, it's not gonna work out, yeah, it's.;;;
external: It won't work, no, okay. so it would have to be a physical Sim and they're not hard to insert, are they?;;;
internal: Yeah, if you be a simple.;;;
internal: No, no, no, no, not at all. No, the Sim has all the Sim cards sizes so it.;;;
external: No, yeah, alright.;;;

external: It.;;;
external: Exactly.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Thank you for holding apologize for the wait, hello.;;;
external: Yeah, hi.;;;
internal: Hi Sam. so I did some quick remote testing and I went through the previous cases as well. I'm sure sorry for the inconvenience so since you are using exit provided modems. I will be able to remotely log into the modem and check on it configuration to see if there are any issues with that as well, Is it okay if I try to log into the modem remotely?;;;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
external: Yeah, so just so you know the two point four g, we can connect to two point five, nothing like we can connect not working at all.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Not working at all, ok.;;;
external: And they are both flashing on the modem.;;;
internal: Okay, uh, so let me log into the modem and would you be able to, let me know the back address of the modem, it should be in the back of the modem.;;;
external: Yeah, once.;;;
internal: Sure.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
external: So what did you wanna know?;;;
internal: Uh, in the back of the modem, there is a sticker in that sticker, there should be something called Mac.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah, okay, so it's seven four.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: Six F.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
external: Eight eight.;;;
external: C B.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
external: S S.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: C.;;;
internal: Okay. Thank you for that and can you please? let me know is this started recently, did it started recently or or?;;;
external: Well, we had an outage on Monday and Tuesday and it came back online yesterday ago and since then it's been it's been slow.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Okay, okay, what about the distance between the devices and the modem so usually five day is not suitable for longer ranges. so it is not a long range. so it is probably since you are a shop.;;;
external: Well, it's, it's not far and we have an extender anyway so.;;;
internal: Not far.;;;
internal: Okay, you have extended.;;;
external: It shouldn't matter and before the outage it was all working fine.;;;
internal: Okay, so the thing is, so this can be the thing is there's a possibility, uh, after the outage, the modem needs to be reconfigure modem has been affected by the outage or something like that. The thing is that the extend that you?;;;
external: Mm.;;;
internal: Uh, you're using, is it an exit one or is it a third party because I'm not detecting extender third party?;;;
external: Third third party, but we're third party, we're not, we're not connecting to network connecting directly to the.;;;
internal: Wifi modem, okay. In that case so I went through the case history as well. Uh, I would like to suggest a factory is to the modem because they can be issued with the modem configuration that happens because of the outage. so we can, we can do a factories to the modem.;;;
external: Hmm Wifi.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: And then, uh, we will be able to check to check to see if most of the times, these type of issues can be resolved by a quick factory reset, but I need to let you know Sam since you are you guys are running a business? I need to let you know if you guys have done any customized changes to the modem as an example if you guys change.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Your Wifi names, Wifi passwords or unique.;;;
external: No, it's all. it's all just based off what it was.;;;
internal: Okay, so that means so usually do you, do you have a security system configure to the modem anything a C cctv or something like that or any port forward?;;;
external: Uh, yea, we do.;;;
internal: Uh, huh, that's the thing is if you have done the done, those specific configurations to the modem. you might need to, you need to reconfigure the modem again And I'm not, I won't be able to help you out with that. So that's why I need to confirm.;;;
external: Today.;;;
external: Is connecting to the Wifi that is it?;;;
internal: Disconnecting to the Wifi, ok, then you will be able to reconnect it through the Wifi.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Ok, so what is the device on the land one, is that you are extended?;;;
external: It's just a, eh, it's just a desktop.;;;
internal: Next, okay, okay. In that case I think we are good to go. So let's do a hard reset to the model. So in order to do this reset you will be able to see in the top of the modem. there is a small hale. So you need to get a pay for a pin place it inside the hall and press it down for eight to ten seconds.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: And you will be able to see all the lights in the modem, they will go off.;;;
external: Okay, one sec.;;;
internal: Sure, take your time.;;;
external: Ten seconds as you said.;;;
internal: Yeah, eight to ten seconds, all the lights will go off, only the power light will stay on, okay.;;;
external: Hello.;;;
internal: Yeah, I'm here.;;;
external: Yeah so.;;;
external: Now.;;;
internal: Yeah, yeah, you can do it just checking the checking on the modem right now. I think it's, I think you just, did it did the light went off.;;;
external: Yeah, yeah, so just the power light on.;;;
internal: Okay, then you can let it go then I just gonna check it right now still offline for me, might take a minute to come online.;;;
internal: Oh the lights.;;;
external: By.;;;
external: Hi there, they coming back on there.;;;
external: The two point four is back on.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
external: Trying to.;;;
internal: What about no, because we need to reconfigure the modem, the modem will come online but without any configurations, I will be able to configure it again. So is the Internet light on right now.;;;
external: All the, uh, yea, all the lights back up.;;;
internal: Okay, okay, okay. I think it just came online. give me a minute. I will quickly reconfigure the service and we will get back to you ok.;;;
external: Okay, cool. Thank you.;;;
internal: Worries.;;;
external: The Wifi resetting.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
internal: Bye.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
internal: Thank you for holding apologies for the wait Sam, hello.;;;
external: Oh good.;;;
internal: How are the lights because I just reconfigure the service usually will restart how are the lights?;;;
external: Tell the back on.;;;
external: Mm, the Internet's flashing and the rest and the five days flashing sometimes.;;;
external: So the two point four G.;;;
internal: Okay, I think it just came online. I'm actually with the configurations, uh, right now the modem is reconfigured, ah, would you be able to check and let me know if that has improved, the service is the five G working for you.;;;
external: So I just, I just looks like like it's still slow but.;;;
external: Let me check five G.;;;
internal: Sure.;;;
external: Bay.;;;
internal: I can see devices are already connected. I can see like one two.;;;
internal: Three four devices connected with the Mac. I think there's a Mac also connected.;;;
external: It looks like it's working but it's still not that far.;;;
internal: Ok, so can you please check, let me know the diss between your modem and, uh, and and the devices that you are using because I think.;;;
external: I am standing right next to it on my phone.;;;
internal: Right next to it, okay. so let's run a speed test then so in your phone, is it connected to the two point four G or to the five G?;;;
external: Five five J.;;;
internal: Five G, ok, open up a browser, uh, type in exit speed test and can you run a speed test and let me know the speeds that you are receiving.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: What we are doing now.;;;
external: So it says hundred megabytes.;;;
internal: Uh, so actually you are a hundred m b p s speed plan if you are receiving hundred megabytes that means speeds are right now good. what so would you be able to because I need to find out where the issue is what kind of issue is would you be able to let me know what so is it like what kind of?;;;

external: The one gigabyte link, um.;;;
external: Yeah, the last guy, I was talking to said I could do it direct.;;;
external: Test to find out, you know, the, the true speed I could get.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: Alright, mm, can you check whether the cable that you're using? it should be printed on the cable, whether it's a cat five E or a cat six cable?;;;
external: Ah, yeah, pretty sure, let me check, mm.;;;
external: It doesn't actually have it printed on here.;;;
external: Hmm, I can.;;;
external: And I've definitely got.;;;
external: A cat cable, I can swap it out just in case.;;;
internal: Oh, yeah, let's just sort it out and then run a speed test because sometimes cables can have limitations as well.;;;
external: That is it.;;;
internal: So, uh, and before use swap the cables just restart the device, the optum device also.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah, sure on, yeah.;;;

external: Incorrect call out then it's a two hundred dollar fee or whatever.;;;
internal: Yeah, exactly, yeah, but.;;;
external: So yeah, the last guy said before we arranged for that there was a test. I could do.;;;
external: I have to test the direct.;;;
external: Link speed, not the Internet speed is that is that a thing like?;;;
external: To check what, mm, you know, the actual bandwidth capacity is into my.;;;
external: On the unit.;;;
internal: Uh, so, uh, yeah that I think that would be the test that you just did the direct Ppoe connection.;;;

internal: Yeah.;;;

internal: Like.;;;
internal: Anyways, what I'll do is, I'll lodge in a fault with the Mbn as well, right.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;

internal: Look into this issue as well, just give me a moment, I'll try to log in a fault, okay.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: You sure, the cable is connected properly, right?;;;

internal: Can you remove the cable and can you remove the cable from the outlet and fix it back again?;;;
internal: Do you have another cable with you?;;;
external: Now.;;;
external: No, we've had this, we, we have had this issue before to be honest. They told us there was a wiring issue and.;;;
internal: So then before you know to B, it's better if you can fix it from your end.;;;
internal: Because if they do the test and find the same resource.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Then it will be, I think it's better if you can sort out the issue from your end first.;;;
external: Okay, um.;;;
internal: Ok, just just for a, we see what is happening now, right?;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;

external: The other line.;;;
external: Arrive, it should be a pardon and then he put that he dropped down, then pay password something like that.;;;
external: Yeah, it looks like the same issue like broadband is flashing and not working bi.;;;
internal: Yeah, yeah, more more than a more than a slow speed issue. The slow speed issue has been good that we used even that a slow speed issue. What I can see is because of this internal wiring is that you are getting this issue continuously.;;;

external: Okay.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Well, it's one of those things that I've been sort of playing around with a little bit hmm and.;;;
internal: Need to be pretty high technical sort of to know how to use that. hmm. I'll, I'll leave it enabled anyway so just in case.;;1;
external: Yeah, that's right.;;;
external: Yeah, yeah, I leave it on I'm aiming to go to to use that sort of a lot more, but it's just finding the time to get everything configured properly. But I have, I have had a couple of little goes at it. and it's, uh, definitely something, we would like to use, yeah, sure.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Alright, so it's on dynamic at the moment, so it's cge the dynamic and then I move it to static. so the current Ip would just go to static and stay as is and then I'll make sure that you can still save the Internet so five dollars per month here. we go so your current Ip address, uh, for.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Ill just refresh the screen here is one two two.;;;
internal: Dot one nine nine.;;;

external: Oh, hang on our router's probably not switched over, but I'll just, I'm just onto it, that's fine.;;;
internal: It shows.;;;
external: Okay on.;;;
external: Done it just got to find the right screen. I've got a million screens open as usual.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: So just do a simple Google search that will confirm if you have got live access.;;;

internal: It is absolutely, yeah, say new fibre to the home connected working.;;;
external: It's okay, I put the thing in.;;;

internal: I'm not sure that it should be.;;;
external: Um.;;;
external: Status.;;;
external: Interfaces.;;;
external: It's not, uh, oh, yeah, what twenty six eighty four. that's what you said was that, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, well, the router's picked up the D H C P address that's fine so.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Just drop authentication there. can, I will just refresh the screen here. so it's just drop authentication for no reason unless he's done something in your router. Can I get you to lift the, the network cable in the router out and back in again?;;;
external: Uh, yeah, it could be this firewall. it just, it tends to take its time to to, uh, market gateway is up. So it, it takes it can takes out five minutes before it decides that the gateway is live. So we're using I'm using something called Ps sensor. I don't know if it's coming across that which is sort of like a.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: Sounds like, you're all up to date, probably more than I am.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: I'm sure it's gonna be work. I'm sure it's gonna be okay. this. I mean it's picked up the new Ip address that you've given us with the D Happ. So I'm sure it'll be fine.;;;
internal: So it's probably done a release and trying to recover now.;;;
external: It yes, but as I say the actual, hmm Pf stand, Fi will decide sort of waits for about five minutes before it decides that it's going to actually flag the gateway as well even though the Ip address has changed.

external: Yeah, hi.;;;
internal: Hi Sam. so I did some quick remote testing and I went through the previous cases as well. I'm sure sorry for the inconvenience so since you are using exit provided modems. I will be able to remotely log into the modem and check on it configuration to see if there are any issues with that as well, Is it okay if I try to log into the modem remotely?;;;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
external: Yeah, so just so you know the two point four g, we can connect to two point five, nothing like we can connect not working at all.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Not working at all, ok.;;;
external: And they are both flashing on the modem.;;;
internal: Okay, uh, so let me log into the modem and would you be able to, let me know the back address of the modem, it should be in the back of the modem.;;;
external: Yeah, once.;;;
internal: Sure.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
external: So what did you wanna know?;;;
internal: Uh, in the back of the modem, there is a sticker in that sticker, there should be something called Mac.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah, okay, so it's seven four.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: Six F.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
external: Eight eight.;;;
external: C B.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
external: S S.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: C.;;;
internal: Okay. Thank you for that and can you please? let me know is this started recently, did it started recently or or?;;;
external: Well, we had an outage on Monday and Tuesday and it came back online yesterday ago and since then it's been it's been slow.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Okay, okay, what about the distance between the devices and the modem so usually five day is not suitable for longer ranges. so it is not a long range. so it is probably since you are a shop.;;;
external: Well, it's, it's not far and we have an extender anyway so.;;;
internal: Not far.;;;
internal: Okay, you have extended.;;;
external: It shouldn't matter and before the outage it was all working fine.;;;
internal: Okay, so the thing is, so this can be the thing is there's a possibility, uh, after the outage, the modem needs to be reconfigure modem has been affected by the outage or something like that. The thing is that the extend that you?;;;
external: Mm.;;;
internal: Uh, you're using, is it an exit one or is it a third party because I'm not detecting extender third party?;;;
external: Third third party, but we're third party, we're not, we're not connecting to network connecting directly to the.;;;
internal: Wifi modem, okay. In that case so I went through the case history as well. Uh, I would like to suggest a factory is to the modem because they can be issued with the modem configuration that happens because of the outage. so we can, we can do a factories to the modem.;;;
external: Hmm Wifi.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: And then, uh, we will be able to check to check to see if most of the times, these type of issues can be resolved by a quick factory reset, but I need to let you know Sam since you are you guys are running a business? I need to let you know if you guys have done any customized changes to the modem as an example if you guys change.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Your Wifi names, Wifi passwords or unique.;;;
external: No, it's all. it's all just based off what it was.;;;
internal: Okay, so that means so usually do you, do you have a security system configure to the modem anything a C cctv or something like that or any port forward?;;;
external: Uh, yea, we do.;;;
internal: Uh, huh, that's the thing is if you have done the done, those specific configurations to the modem. you might need to, you need to reconfigure the modem again And I'm not, I won't be able to help you out with that. So that's why I need to confirm.;;;
external: Today.;;;
external: Is connecting to the Wifi that is it?;;;
internal: Disconnecting to the Wifi, ok, then you will be able to reconnect it through the Wifi.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Ok, so what is the device on the land one, is that you are extended?;;;
external: It's just a, eh, it's just a desktop.;;;
internal: Next, okay, okay. In that case I think we are good to go. So let's do a hard reset to the model. So in order to do this reset you will be able to see in the top of the modem. there is a small hale. So you need to get a pay for a pin place it inside the hall and press it down for eight to ten seconds.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: And you will be able to see all the lights in the modem, they will go off.;;;
external: Okay, one sec.;;;
internal: Sure, take your time.;;;
external: Ten seconds as you said.;;;
internal: Yeah, eight to ten seconds, all the lights will go off, only the power light will stay on, okay.;;;
external: Hello.;;;
internal: Yeah, I'm here.;;;
external: Yeah so.;;;
external: Now.;;;
internal: Yeah, yeah, you can do it just checking the checking on the modem right now. I think it's, I think you just, did it did the light went off.;;;
external: Yeah, yeah, so just the power light on.;;;
internal: Okay, then you can let it go then I just gonna check it right now still offline for me, might take a minute to come online.;;;
internal: Oh the lights.;;;
external: By.;;;
external: Hi there, they coming back on there.;;;
external: The two point four is back on.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
external: Trying to.;;;

external: Tell the back on.;;;
external: Mm, the Internet's flashing and the rest and the five days flashing sometimes.;;;
external: So the two point four G.;;;
internal: Okay, I think it just came online. I'm actually with the configurations, uh, right now the modem is reconfigured, ah, would you be able to check and let me know if that has improved, the service is the five G working for you.;;;
external: So I just, I just looks like like it's still slow but.;;;
external: Let me check five G.;;;
internal: Sure.;;;
external: Bay.;;;
internal: I can see devices are already connected. I can see like one two.;;;
internal: Three four devices connected with the Mac. I think there's a Mac also connected.;;;
external: It looks like it's working but it's still not that far.;;;
internal: Ok, so can you please check, let me know the diss between your modem and, uh, and and the devices that you are using because I think.;;;
external: I am standing right next to it on my phone.;;;
internal: Right next to it, okay. so let's run a speed test then so in your phone, is it connected to the two point four G or to the five G?;;;
external: Five five J.;;;
internal: Five G, ok, open up a browser, uh, type in exit speed test and can you run a speed test and let me know the speeds that you are receiving.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: What we are doing now.;;;
external: So it says hundred megabytes.;;;

internal: So if there is a shortfall, we can arrange m b m to send out the device for you.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
external: Okay, would you charge me for that how much?;;;
internal: Yeah, so it depends on the service class and the technology da, which comes into your address. So let me just just bear with me. I'll just do the qualification and let you know, right mam. thank you.;;1;
external: Mhm.;;;
external: Sure.;;;
internal: The wrong.;;;
internal: Um.;;;
internal: Let say you just saw the message on that check check.;;;
internal: Yeah, it is.;;;
internal: It looks like the connection device box is available at the property. I recommend you chance.;;;
internal: One five.;;;
internal: Probably.;;;
internal: Alright, so B says that there is a shortfall at this site, right at the lowest.;;;
internal: Level right now so that needs to be arranged. Let me just check with the team if there would be any additional charges because if it's just one service class below, there won't be any additional charges but then there are two service class lower than the full complete infrastructure Spn. so just let me check on this for you.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Can get back to you soon, right?;;;
external: Sure.;;;
internal: Thank you.;;;
external: Bye.;;;
internal: Hello Philo.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Hey, so there would be a deck up payment needed for this. So it would drop the tech fourteen to twenty five days for the service to be completed. I mean like for the technician to come into your site and get all the needful done. so M b m, we will be able to book in a M B M technician and that will be.;;1;
internal: Of no additional charge.;;;
external: Uh, but it, it'll take two two weeks.;;;
internal: Yeah, so no matter with whom you got.;;;
internal: This will take that time because we need to arrange M B M technician with in premise and then have them get to work completed.;;1;
external: Uh.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: And there's no way to make it sooner.;;;
internal: So usually how this happens is that once we put in this order, the provision team will look into.;;;
internal: Available date with the technician. So it's just that you're not quite exactly sure like when the next Vail would be De because Pro team would have this other deaths system.;;1;
external: Mhm.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
internal: However, yeah, so it will be most likely within two weeks period but then.;;;
internal: Uh, it could be even more so it could be from fourteen to twenty five days. So most of the time it would be the earliest. I mean like to close the day.;;;
external: Uh, and, uh.;;;
external: Until it happens, can I put my, my, my Internet service with you on hold.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: Because I'm not using it and there is no way for me to use it.;;;
internal: Yeah, so your service as like your current.;;;
internal: Active account.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
internal: Yeah, your current active account, you can put a cancellation through and your new order you can put that through and then that will be pending and until the technician come and completes their work so that will be pending.;;1;
external: But, uh, I don't, but I don't need to cancel it because I'm not, I have, uh, I have a discount for half a year using it and I'm not, I'm not done with it yet.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
external: So I just want to put it on hold.;;;
internal: No, unfortunately, we can't hold that as it is.;;;
internal: So yeah.;;;
internal: We can't hold to suspend any.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Okay, can I use, can I use?;;;
external: In this case, can I use the remaining three months of discounts on as a part of my new account?;;;
internal: Right.;;;
internal: Technical center.;;1;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: Yeah, you can continue, you can even have two accounts opened up, Ah, if I mean like if you want to, you can have both the addresses as well.;;;
external: Okay, so now now what I need to do is cancel my current subscription and and and start a new one with Franklin Franklin Road, when the installation is complete, right.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Uh, no, so installation won't be completed until we put in the order so first, we need to place an order then the provisioning team will book in the technician to get the work done.;;1;
external: Okay and how do.;;;
external: Okay, so what what do I do next?;;;
internal: Alright, so right now, yeah, you need to put the order in and then we'll be able to transfer that to to get that service like.;;;
external: I put through the order.;;;
external: Uh.;;;
external: Okay, I'm.;;;
external: I'm in, I'm in my, uh, exit account. what, what do I do now?;;;
internal: I.;;;
external: What, where do I go into what do I?;;;
external: What should I do next?;;;
internal: Alright, so do you already have the plan, so I can do that for you, it a bit easy that.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Yes please.;;;
internal: Right, uh, so what, what plans will it be going into, will it be the same plan?;;;
external: Uh, yes.;;;
internal: Alright, so twenty five by ten, right.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
internal: Okay, so for this plan.;;;
internal: It would be fifty three point nine nine six months, then sixty four point nine nine ongoing price.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
internal: Okay, put just that in.;;;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: I'm just checking if you are gonna be bringing in your own modem or do you need a modem for my?;;;
external: Uh, I have my own modem, thank you.;;;
internal: Correct.;;;
external: All that all that I require no B M B M box.;;;
internal: Yeah, so that one will be arranged from us. so we will a technician to come into your site and get that activated.;;1;
internal: I'll reset your my ex password. so that I can pull in all the details from your old account into can everything remain the same including payments like the payment details and everything else.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Yes, yes please.;;;
internal: Alright, I will just.;;;
external: No.;;;
internal: The.;;;
internal: I will put the date in activation for as soon as possible, but then do you have any preferred date in mind to have the service activated?;;;
external: As soon as possible.;;;
internal: Right alright, I'll put that in, so we'll be able to book in the technician visit and get the work started then.;;1;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Three zero.;;;
external: Uh, do you know what date, uh, at least approximately I should look look forward?;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Mm, let me just check this.;;;
internal: Thirty eight dollars.;;;
internal: So by September and two three.;;;
internal: By the third week of September, like to us the end of September, you can.;;;
internal: Get that service activated.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
internal: It also depending on how much work is required to M B M to hall in the cable to.;;;
external: By the end of September.;;;
internal: Your property and get the installation done.;;;
internal: So it time frame changes. I mean like it varies basic amount of it could be less or more, yeah.;;;
external: Uh, okay, uh, okay.;;;
external: Another question is there, is there some not sure if you know or not not but if is there's some sort of an alternative to Mbn connection.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: Available to this property.;;;
internal: So right now we just have optum and M b m, so since this address qualifies for sorry, M B M, we won't be able to choose. I mean like the area itself, it's by Mbn. So if the area has two options, we could have tried something else but since area served by Mbn, we won't be able to.;;;
internal: Do any changes since all the infrastructure in the area is by M.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Uh.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: If, uh, this is the only way then I'll, I'll take it uh, thank you very much.;;;
internal: Alright, can I put the order in then for the new address, alright, I put that in.;;;
external: Yes please.;;;
internal: And then for your current address at, will you be letting us know when you would want to cancel the service?;;;
external: And this.;;;
external: Uh, no.;;;
internal: Alright, so you don't want.;;;
external: No, no, we, we've already moved in.;;;
internal: You have already moved into Franklin Road.;;;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
external: We just cook, we just didn't have the opportunity to arrange everything.;;;
internal: Right, right, no worries. So I can put in the cancellation for unit six separate for tomorrow. so that's the earliest I can do for cancellation right. So I'll put that in and we'll get that new address started. I'll transfer the case over to provision team.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Reach out to you with the appointment date and time and if you are okay with it.;;;
external: Okay, yeah, yes, so yes, so what about my, uh, first six months discount, will it resume with the new property, will it be cancelled?;;;
internal: No, it won't resume with a new property. You will get a new six month so from.;;;
internal: You will get another six months now.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Good good.;;;
internal: That will go on as.;;;
external: Um.;;;
internal: Just yes.;;;
external: Okay then, um.;;;
external: So now the only question that I have left is that when approximate, when will I, when will I get the exact date as for?;;;
internal: Mm.;;;
external: Uh, the installation due.;;;
internal: Only after the site is done by M B M technician. they can do the survey and they can let you know like approximately how long it would take because they'll have to serve decide and see how much work is needed. And then they can get an estimated date for activation.;;1;
external: Mhm.;;;
internal: Yeah, so unfortunately I don't have that I just have the basic time frame which is fourteen to twenty five days but then it could be even less or based on how much of work is needed. so it depends on.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: The total time frame which is within the period would be fourteen to twenty five days.;;;
external: Ok.;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
internal: Is anything else?;;;
external: No, that's it.;;;
external: Will will, I get a notification of the installation on my email or?;;;

internal: Okay.;;;
external: Sorry, I'm driving so.;;;
internal: No, no, no worries In that case, I will be able to provide you an email address for verification please.;;;
external: Yeah, it's Francesca s g at gmail dot com. so it's my first and last name at gmail dot.;;;
internal: Okay. Thank you for that information. So in this with regards to your connection type, there won't be any Technic technician which is required to get it connected. You have requested for a modem, right.;;1;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: The modem to be shipped to me, yeah, that's different. We don't have an M B M box at all.;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Uh, yeah, no as this connection. there's, no, there's no, any requirement of an M B M box. once you receive the modem, you will just have to get it connected connected to a telephone fall socket and a power outlet. then you will be able to like you will be able to get this like you will be able to use the connection.;;;
internal: This connection is active like it has been gone for like if I am to give you a clear picture. You have requested for a fibre upgrade to the premature upgrade, okay. The procedure would be first of all we will be getting you, the ft connection, the fibre to the, no connection active.;;;
external: Yes, yes.;;;
internal: Once that is active only, we will be proceeding with the fibre to the premises connection because as per your location, we can straight away proceed with the fibre to the premises connection because the infrastructure and all those things have not been built. So the usual procedure with Mbn recommends it first. We get the Fibre connection active.;;;
external: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: To get the Fibre connection active, you won't like there won't be any technical which would be required. Once you receive the modem. Please plug the modem to the power outlet and to the wall, okay. And once the service service is active, you will be able to use the connection and then once the fibre to the note connect.;;1;
internal: In active fibre to the premises plan upgrade will be processing for that. there would be a tech which would be required. Uh, will be providing all those details once the order has been processed.;;1;
external: So when will my fire to the, not be activated?;;;
internal: Uh, like if you have a modem with you like the modem has not been shipped out yet because the payment has been done through a direct debit payment. So usually it would take half around three to four days for the verification to be sorted out once the verification is passed. then only the modem will be getting dispatched.;;;
internal: So in that case, if you have a spare modem like if you have another modem with you, which you could use until the new modem arrives, you will be able to get the connection up and running now it says.;;;
external: Yes, so I have a spare modem with me. Are you able to send us the settings required, so I can do it?;;;
internal: Oh shoot.;;;
internal: Sure, sure, no problem. Shall I get the connection up and running first and then once along with the connection activation notification, you will be receiving the modem configuration details as well.;;;
external: After what?;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Okay, Would you mind giving me a couple of minutes until I get everything updated?;;;
internal: Ok, thank you, please stay on line.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
internal: Bye.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: Mm.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: By.;;;
internal: Hello, thank you for staying on line.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Yes, you have updated all the things which are required for the activation to a supplier. So the usual time frame would be a twenty four hour time frame for the activation to trigger on, but there are possibilities where it could happen within a couple of hours as well. So once you receive the notification, please get your modem configured as well the modem which you have now so that you could.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Use the connection and please get the modem plugged into the wall socket and the power outlet as well.;;;
external: Okay, so you're gonna, I'm gonna get an email for the configuration.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
internal: Uh, yes, you will be receiving an email for the configuration and with regards to the new modem which has been requested. I see the payments have been updated today. it shows that it has been updated today. So it, it would be roughly around four days for the verification to be done And hopefully on the sixth of September, the modem, the new modem which was.;;;
internal: Requested, we'll be getting dispatched.;;;
external: Okay, cool, okay. Thank you so much. So you have done everything and we'll just have to wait for the configuration.;;;
internal: No.;;;
internal: No.;;;
internal: Yes, for the activation notification and for the modem configuration. Is there anything else I could help you out?;;;
external: Oh.;;;
external: Oh good. Thank you so much.;;;
internal: Okay, Thank you for calling Super Loop and before you go, there would be a quick one question survey at the end of this call to rate the service which I just provided to you. shall I pass you through it will just take tens of time.;;;

external: Lets see if I can do that, okay.;;;
external: Gone over to my mobile phone within web address.;;;
internal: Hmm.;;;
external: Then.;;;
external: What I wanted, okay.;;;
external: That's not what I wanted, um.;;;

external: Okay, sorry about this. I should have done it before I gone on.;;;
internal: No worries. No worries. Take your time, take your time.;;;
external: Here, we go coming up.;;;
external: The problem, I'm having, I mean, are you running five G as well as four g?;;;
internal: Uh, currently sir. We have only most of our plans are for for G and only one plan which is our highest tier is for five G sir.;;;
external: Yeah, my plan is fifty dollars and I get, um.;;;
external: Uh, I've got ninety nine point seven two gigabytes of data out of a hundred gigabytes, mm, then when I only got to bill the other day last week. so it's only recent so but I mean my good morning homepage.;;;
external: Not giving me anything more.;;;
external: International calls data.;;;
external: I've got ninety nine point seven two gigabytes available usage information here we go.;;;
external: No, it's not going to tell me.;;;
external: Oh, yea, so I'm on a fifty dollar plan. I'm obviously, I am getting a hundred gigabyte, um, ok so.;;;
external: I need to go up. I'm quite happy to sort of pay up up to the fifty dollars. It doesn't really worry. So what, what plans have you got the close of the fifty dollars. I just don't want to get short that's all.;;;
internal: Mm, okay. so, uh, sim's closer to fifty dollar range is the closest one we have is for forty five dollars.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
internal: It's for ninety Gb of data with unlimited national calls and tax and also unlimited international calls and sms's to fifteen different countries.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Right, ok, that's that sort of sounds a bit like the Vodafone one that I've got, mm.;;;
internal: Mm.;;;
external: Yeah, look, okay. look. I think I might go with that and it's not the dollar. I know the difference in dollar. I don't want the, what was it sixteen dollars or something, wasn't it?;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah, I don't want that. I mean that's, that's just too small. I mean I use this for business. I don't do a lot of international, very few international calls. mm, if I go overseas and I want to use my phone overseas, Vodafone has a five dollar per day to once you open your phone. Do you have anything like that?;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: That plan.;;;
internal: Yes, we have something called, uh, roaming pa G services. so you can just hmm add, uh, the amount of data that you need. We have either one G B add on or we have a five Gb add on. So you can choose which one you want and.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
internal: Apply for the service.;;;
external: Okay, look, I think I go change over to that forty five dollar plan. I've been, I've been with you guys for a million years and I've also been with Vodafone since I think our first mobile phones came out but mm, I'm just not getting the reception. I've been away a few times, particularly lately to the country And I've been down to mm, King Ireland of Tasmania and that and I'm.;;;

internal: Yeah, yeah.;;;
internal: By.;;;
internal: Um.;;;
external: And.;;;
internal: Uh, yeah, yes.;;;

internal: Uh, two two weeks.;;;
external: Right.;;;
internal: One to two weeks, hmm.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: But we can go ahead and do this and then the good thing is, you will have an active service on your current phone until the service is activated on the new Sim.;;;
external: Right.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;

internal: Thank you.;;;
external: Bye.;;;
internal: Hello Philo.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Hey, so there would be a deck up payment needed for this. So it would drop the tech fourteen to twenty five days for the service to be completed. I mean like for the technician to come into your site and get all the needful done. so M b m, we will be able to book in a M B M technician and that will be.;;1;
internal: Of no additional charge.;;;
external: Uh, but it, it'll take two two weeks.;;;
internal: Yeah, so no matter with whom you got.;;;
internal: This will take that time because we need to arrange M B M technician with in premise and then have them get to work completed.;;1;
external: Uh.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: And there's no way to make it sooner.;;;
internal: So usually how this happens is that once we put in this order, the provision team will look into.;;;
internal: Available date with the technician. So it's just that you're not quite exactly sure like when the next Vail would be De because Pro team would have this other deaths system.;;1;
external: Mhm.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
internal: However, yeah, so it will be most likely within two weeks period but then.;;;
internal: Uh, it could be even more so it could be from fourteen to twenty five days. So most of the time it would be the earliest. I mean like to close the day.;;;
external: Uh, and, uh.;;;
external: Until it happens, can I put my, my, my Internet service with you on hold.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: Because I'm not using it and there is no way for me to use it.;;;
internal: Yeah, so your service as like your current.;;;
internal: Active account.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
internal: Yeah, your current active account, you can put a cancellation through and your new order you can put that through and then that will be pending and until the technician come and completes their work so that will be pending.;;1;
external: But, uh, I don't, but I don't need to cancel it because I'm not, I have, uh, I have a discount for half a year using it and I'm not, I'm not done with it yet.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
external: So I just want to put it on hold.;;;
internal: No, unfortunately, we can't hold that as it is.;;;
internal: So yeah.;;;
internal: We can't hold to suspend any.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Okay, can I use, can I use?;;;
external: In this case, can I use the remaining three months of discounts on as a part of my new account?;;;
internal: Right.;;;
internal: Technical center.;;1;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: Yeah, you can continue, you can even have two accounts opened up, Ah, if I mean like if you want to, you can have both the addresses as well.;;;
external: Okay, so now now what I need to do is cancel my current subscription and and and start a new one with Franklin Franklin Road, when the installation is complete, right.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Uh, no, so installation won't be completed until we put in the order so first, we need to place an order then the provisioning team will book in the technician to get the work done.;;1;
external: Okay and how do.;;;
external: Okay, so what what do I do next?;;;
internal: Alright, so right now, yeah, you need to put the order in and then we'll be able to transfer that to to get that service like.;;;
external: I put through the order.;;;
external: Uh.;;;
external: Okay, I'm.;;;
external: I'm in, I'm in my, uh, exit account. what, what do I do now?;;;
internal: I.;;;
external: What, where do I go into what do I?;;;
external: What should I do next?;;;
internal: Alright, so do you already have the plan, so I can do that for you, it a bit easy that.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Yes please.;;;
internal: Right, uh, so what, what plans will it be going into, will it be the same plan?;;;
external: Uh, yes.;;;
internal: Alright, so twenty five by ten, right.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
internal: Okay, so for this plan.;;;
internal: It would be fifty three point nine nine six months, then sixty four point nine nine ongoing price.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
internal: Okay, put just that in.;;;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: I'm just checking if you are gonna be bringing in your own modem or do you need a modem for my?;;;
external: Uh, I have my own modem, thank you.;;;
internal: Correct.;;;
external: All that all that I require no B M B M box.;;;
internal: Yeah, so that one will be arranged from us. so we will a technician to come into your site and get that activated.;;1;
internal: I'll reset your my ex password. so that I can pull in all the details from your old account into can everything remain the same including payments like the payment details and everything else.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Yes, yes please.;;;
internal: Alright, I will just.;;;
external: No.;;;
internal: The.;;;
internal: I will put the date in activation for as soon as possible, but then do you have any preferred date in mind to have the service activated?;;;
external: As soon as possible.;;;
internal: Right alright, I'll put that in, so we'll be able to book in the technician visit and get the work started then.;;1;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Three zero.;;;
external: Uh, do you know what date, uh, at least approximately I should look look forward?;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Mm, let me just check this.;;;
internal: Thirty eight dollars.;;;
internal: So by September and two three.;;;
internal: By the third week of September, like to us the end of September, you can.;;;
internal: Get that service activated.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
internal: It also depending on how much work is required to M B M to hall in the cable to.;;;
external: By the end of September.;;;
internal: Your property and get the installation done.;;;
internal: So it time frame changes. I mean like it varies basic amount of it could be less or more, yeah.;;;
external: Uh, okay, uh, okay.;;;
external: Another question is there, is there some not sure if you know or not not but if is there's some sort of an alternative to Mbn connection.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: Available to this property.;;;
internal: So right now we just have optum and M b m, so since this address qualifies for sorry, M B M, we won't be able to choose. I mean like the area itself, it's by Mbn. So if the area has two options, we could have tried something else but since area served by Mbn, we won't be able to.;;;
internal: Do any changes since all the infrastructure in the area is by M.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Uh.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: If, uh, this is the only way then I'll, I'll take it uh, thank you very much.;;;
internal: Alright, can I put the order in then for the new address, alright, I put that in.;;;
external: Yes please.;;;
internal: And then for your current address at, will you be letting us know when you would want to cancel the service?;;;
external: And this.;;;
external: Uh, no.;;;
internal: Alright, so you don't want.;;;
external: No, no, we, we've already moved in.;;;
internal: You have already moved into Franklin Road.;;;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
external: We just cook, we just didn't have the opportunity to arrange everything.;;;
internal: Right, right, no worries. So I can put in the cancellation for unit six separate for tomorrow. so that's the earliest I can do for cancellation right. So I'll put that in and we'll get that new address started. I'll transfer the case over to provision team.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Reach out to you with the appointment date and time and if you are okay with it.;;;
external: Okay, yeah, yes, so yes, so what about my, uh, first six months discount, will it resume with the new property, will it be cancelled?;;;
internal: No, it won't resume with a new property. You will get a new six month so from.;;;
internal: You will get another six months now.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Good good.;;;
internal: That will go on as.;;;
external: Um.;;;
internal: Just yes.;;;
external: Okay then, um.;;;
external: So now the only question that I have left is that when approximate, when will I, when will I get the exact date as for?;;;
internal: Mm.;;;
external: Uh, the installation due.;;;
internal: Only after the site is done by M B M technician. they can do the survey and they can let you know like approximately how long it would take because they'll have to serve decide and see how much work is needed. And then they can get an estimated date for activation.;;1;
external: Mhm.;;;
internal: Yeah, so unfortunately I don't have that I just have the basic time frame which is fourteen to twenty five days but then it could be even less or based on how much of work is needed. so it depends on.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: The total time frame which is within the period would be fourteen to twenty five days.;;;
external: Ok.;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
internal: Is anything else?;;;
external: No, that's it.;;;
external: Will will, I get a notification of the installation on my email or?;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: You will get an Sms.;;;
internal: So the provision team will send you an Sms in touch. This has been booked in if you are okay with it, you can proceed with the mention date. If you want to change, you can call our provisioning team and then the provisioning team will be able to reschedule the appointment and put in a new date for you, which you available.;;;

I actually got the, the real estate people to go to the property and check for the box number Now. What they informed me that. They're really lovely to actually help. they informed me that the previous tenants there.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: The previous rentals there had mbn with Iinet. They had a box there and everything. However, I think they're a little bit too cheap, so what has happened is when they have left, They've actually taken the box as well. so they've actually asked Iinet to remove the box. so they can get refunded whatever money, they're going to get refunded.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
internal: So they have to take on the M B N device, is it?;;;
external: They have taken the N C D box. it's called they said he said to me, it's been taken out. So there's no box there because of the stupid of them, yeah.;;;
internal: There's no box, okay. Jeremy. could you confirm the, uh, the new address for me just to make sure I'm looking at the right?;;;
external: Yes.;;;
external: Yeah, its, uh, unit one.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
external: Number three.;;;
internal: Number three, ok.;;;
external: Ben Bridge Avenue, That's B E N B R I.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: In Frank.;;;
internal: France in South Victoria, three one double nine, right?;;;
external: Correct.;;;
external: So all the houses in in the complex have mbn and the box there, but I think I believe that's what happens which makes sense. why, why we don't have anything.;;;
internal: Okay, let me check, alright.;;;
external: Bye.;;;
internal: I think the problem we have is unit one number three Bambridge Avenue. It's not available on the M B M portal, right, uh, hold on.;;;
external: Yes.;;;
external: Yeah, correct. so the problem I am seeing is though is that because I have had m b N in all my other houses now so far and with all of them. We've had the box outside. We've had the, when we've had the connection created. There's, so there is definitely a fibre that goes to the entire property, the entire property including unit.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: One, there's fire there. however, what has happened is the idiots who are living there before us. They are just like I said it's too cheap and they've taken the whole thing out including the box so they've got Iinet to take it out. So what he's suggested is, he said that he might, I might have to get you guys to speak to Iinet or whoever in order to get.;;;
internal: Uh, uh.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: Going again because it seems like they've obviously done some stupid mistake there and they pulled it up And I don't want to keep changing provider I like you guys so far and I want to stick so I was hoping to get the solution organized. So you know by next week we can actually happen. we moved there next weekend. We can have the Internet there.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: I understand, yeah.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Okay, well, so hmm here, uh, Jeremiah. I found three addresses in the M B N portal, right one is just number three Bambridge Avenue, the second address is.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Correct, that's the, that's the property, yeah, correct.;;;
internal: Okay, The second address is Unit two number three Bambridge Avenue. The other one is Unit three number three, Ben Ridge Avenue and then unit four unit five likewise, right, so are you in just three Bambridge Avenue?;;;
external: Correct.;;;
external: Exactly, yeah.;;;
external: No, no, no, no, see that's the thing it. I don't know what it is showing as it could just be three Bens Avenue.;;;
internal: But you're not a hundred percent sure, right.;;;
external: Because it's the first house.;;;
external: Yeah, because my, the thing is, it's an apartment, its sorry, it's not apartment, it's units and there's there's about eight town houses attached to each other and mine is the first one. So I believe I have a feeling that it could actually just be listed as number three rather than unit one.;;;
internal: It is a town.;;;
internal: It must be just.;;;
internal: Great.;;;
internal: Right.;;;
external: Because there definitely like I said he, they checked it. He said that you know it used to be there. He's, he's definitely sure of that and the thing is the way I see it, you can't put a, you can't put a fibre.;;;
internal: Well.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: Past the first house without, you know, tapping into the first house and then go through all the rest of the houses, yeah.;;;
internal: I know, yeah.;;;
internal: I know, okay, one second. so what happened was the agent, the very first day when you poor. we have sent an email to, uh, mbn asking to update the address as unit one slash three, Ben Bridge Avenue, right. And then they have what they have said is.;;;
external: Sorry.;;;
external: Yeah, so yeah.;;;
external: They asked for a serial number on the box, is that correct?;;;
internal: Serial number but you don't have that right.;;;
external: Yeah, well, that's the thing there's notice because these like I said these people are, I think they were just pro. I think they were stupid and I think they pulled it out themselves because what's happened is even when I saw the house there, you know, they've made some stupid changes here and they're all ridiculous stuff. So I believe what's happened is they've basically gone and done the wrong thing.;;;
internal: Okay, so then.;;;
internal: Done the wrong thing, yeah.;;;
internal: Can I put you on hold for a moment. I'll have a word with my manager as well see what we can do And I'll be back with you sooner, right?;;;

internal: Uh.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: No.;;;
internal: Hi Jemma. Thank you so much for being online. I think we will be sending another email to Mbn. The thing is hmm. We can tell them the N T D device was removed by the previous Asian and you.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: I've already sent the proof of Occupancy document which shows the address as unit one, uh, slash three Bambridge Avenue. Uh, we'll have to wait til, M gets back to us on this like first step. We were taken to like try to get the address updated in the portal but now we have come across with another.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Yes, yeah.;;;
internal: So we'll see what Mbn says and we can give an update in about two business days, alright.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Okay, yeah, that's perfectly fine. Now. Would you recommend I just call and ask them what the issue was cause obviously they are the ones who are sing the property to start with and they cause it.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: Well, okay, Can you do a favour if you can get a lock Id from Iinet then we can make sure if it was connected to just three Bambridge Avenue. If you can do that actually, this will make so much easier for you and m b m as well.;;;
external: Lock Id, is it?;;;
internal: Lock, I D, yeah, it starts with L O C.;;;
external: Oh, L O C y, find the lock I d, no worries.;;;
internal: Yeah, number, yeah, okay. just get that number for us and then we will escalate to M B was the address connected to M B M previously, but the.;;;
internal: The tenants have taken the device and I think in being cancelled out the matter more promptly in that way.;;;
external: Ok, that's fantastic. What I'll do in that case is, I'll fill it now. I'll try to get a hold of them and then I'll be able to essentially see what what we can do to fix it then because like I said I want to just get it get it all day up to date and start it there. So it ends here on the same day starts there and then we can also just wanted to get a couple more things from you guys organized as well just for the.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;

external: Hello, I just received an email. I received an email yesterday night from you guys saying that my account was activated.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
external: But, uh, the modem is here and everything was configurated and set up by you guys but I can't, I don't have your Internet access yet.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
internal: Okay, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me quickly take a look at your account and do some troubleshooting. Can I have your customer Id or your contact mobile number?;;;
external: My mobile number is zero four five two zero one.;;;
external: Zero nine zero three.;;;
internal: Thank for that for a quick verification. Can I have your full name and your service address with the post code?;;;
external: Yeah, uh, my full name is T H I A G O B o, double r e double L I, uh, address is and post code forty five seventy five.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
internal: Thank you for that and also can I have your date of birth please?;;;
external: Nine of March nineteen eighty four.;;;
internal: So the final verification just sent you a text message with a verification code to your mobile. Would you mind providing me that call?;;;
external: Two zero nine nine seven.;;;
internal: Two zero nine nine seven.;;;
internal: Thank you very much for the verification there. I go the modem that you are using that was provided by Exeter, okay. So is it plugged in to the M B M box, right now?;;;
external: Yes, correct.;;;
external: Uh, I just a quick question here. I have to C storage house here. The first time I'm using the Internet like that. So there is one access point like the connector on the wall, close to the M B M box, which is in the garage and there's another one here on the, on the second floor, the house.;;;
internal: Sure.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Uh, huh, uh, huh.;;;
external: Which I plugged in, I have tried yesterday. I tried it on both of them both on the top one and on the garage one right below right, close to the M B M box, but none of them works.;;;
internal: Mm.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
internal: None of them works, okay. Let me quickly run some testing and I'll be able to get back to you some more information. uh, shall I put you on hold for a minute like like two minutes?;;;
external: Yes.;;;
external: Yeah, just a quick, one quick question here in the morning. I got the yellow cable so I connect one plug on the wall and the second one is on the, the W A N port, is that right or no, okay, okay?;;;
internal: Sure.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
internal: Yeah, yeah, that's correct. It should be on the port from the modem because I need to check the service from the M B N N as well and I'll be able to get back to you with some more information. Yeah, I'll put you on hold. We'll get back to you, okay.;;;
external: Okay, no problem.;;;
external: Yeah, you.;;;
external: Okay, system.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Thank you for holding, I for the wait, hello.;;;
external: Hello.;;;
internal: Hi, so I did some troubleshooting actually. I was able to see the N P M box is online and everything is passing but M P M box is not detecting your modem. So that means the, the main issue is with your cabling and can you please check and let me know is in the modem if the broadband light is on.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Which one.;;;
internal: The broadband light is on in the model, it's not okay. so that means clearly, there is an issue between the connection. So so you told me that you are connecting to the wall socket. So that means you guys, you have Internet wiring in the house. so the thing since we m and exit.;;;
external: No, it's not, that's not not.;;;
internal: We can guarantee up to the M B M boundary point that means the M B M box after that, that means your internal wiring. so probably you need to check the internal wiring so.;;;
internal: So before that let's confirm the service if you don't mind, can you please take the modem and the cabling cable to your garage and connect the modem directly to the M B M box as a trouble shooting step to see if it comes online.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: One second, yeah, this M B M box is am I able to open it or not?;;;
internal: Yeah, sure.;;;
internal: Yeah, yeah, you should be able to, it's a cover. it should, it should be a white colour box. you should be able to pull on that cover and you will be able to completely remove that cover.;;;
external: Six open it up, yeah.;;;
internal: Sure.;;;
external: Yeah, removed here. so the power is on and then the optical is on as well.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: Okay, so the.;;;
external: But there's no.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah, yeah, you can talk.;;;
internal: Yeah, so probably the Id is off. So basically you provision port is the Id one port. So you need to connect the modem to the U I D one port. So if you don't mind, uh, connect the modem to the U I D port one and see if the services come service comes online.;;;
external: Yeah, but how, how do I find this? Oh, yeah, okay. so I have to connect it directly in there one second. I'll try to connect you, give me one second.;;;
internal: Yeah, exactly, yeah.;;;
internal: Sure.;;;
external: So the morning has to stay here directly on the, on the M B M box.;;;
internal: Uh, no, actually you should, you will be able to get it get it inside but you need to figure out. what's the issue with the internal wiring. So are you renting this property? Do you go or are you on this property renting then probably give your landlord or the property manager a call and let them know about your issue. so they will be able to advise.;;;
external: Yeah, yeah.;;;
internal: You on how to connect the internal wire because since you are in a two story house, probably they have internal wiring and they will be able to help you out with the internal wiring as soon as you figure out the internal wiring, you will be able to connect your modem inside and then the service will, you will be able to use the Internet properly inside. You will be able to place the modem inside and get a.;;;
external: Uh.;;;
internal: Get a better Wifi signal. So I'm, I just asked you to connect it directly because I need to make sure the service is working fine, then you will be able to, yeah.;;;
external: Yeah, yeah.;;;
external: It's now, I got the after connecting to U I D one, I got the broadband and Internet lights on the modem working.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
internal: Ok, uh, let me check.;;;
external: But I don't have the five G working yet only two point four now five G is is on now.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
external: Internet is showing red, it's showing in red now like two errors, but it's still in red.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: Still turned green because it's still on the starting process because it's still authenticating.;;;
external: Oh gotcha, yeah, now it's everything turned everything off, but the power one power one's, the only one working at the moment.;;;
internal: Yeah, yeah, so this is, this is the basic set up process because this is the first time you are connecting the modem. Some modem will go through restart the, at least two times then probably come online, let's see.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
external: Got it, okay.;;;
external: So do you think after doing all this set up. I will be able to disconnect from the, from the garage and connect laptop or not.;;;
internal: Eh, you, the thing is, it will depend on the internal wiring. if you don't have any issues with the internal wiring and it properly maintain. and it's all good. then you will be able to connect the modem inside without any issues. You just need to find out. so what you need to let your, uh, property manager know, is let him know that you need.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
internal: To find the internal wiring leading cable so that means in the garage, there should be a cable that you need to plug into the U I D one port that means we need to get your modem connected with the U I D one. so in order to do that you need to connect the internal wiring to the U I D one and.;;;
internal: Then you need to, yeah, yeah, then it will power up the Internet wiring, then you will be able to connect your modem to the wall socket in the premises. But in order to do that you need to find out the internal wiring leading cable. so we don't have that information. unfortunately, otherwise I will definitely help you out so that's.;;;
external: Ah, that.;;;
external: Understood.;;;
external: Got it.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: There you, so I think it came online. How are the lights?;;;
external: Yeah, yeah, it's, it's blinking now but yes, I think so so just to be so just to see if I understood here. there is like one cable that probably what I'm seeing here is deleting cable is right underneath the M B M boxes which is gonna connect me to the top floor to the second floor so I would have to get the.;;;
internal: Yeah, I think it.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
internal: Yeah, it's.;;;
external: A second Orange cable like this one that you, you guys provided me with the morning, connect the M B M box to this cable on the, on the garage and then the M B M box will be connected to the top four, is that right the thinking?;;;
internal: Um.;;;
internal: Yeah, yeah, depend on the internal wiring quality. So if the internal wiring all good and if it's working, yeah.;;;
external: You.;;;
external: Yeah, should be, should be good, yeah, should be good.;;;
internal: Yeah, yeah, so that's all from my end. I think the size is also came online. Just now anything else I can help you with.;;;

external: The question becomes, I don't know how long, my bank will take to issue new credit cards.;;;

external: Now.;;;
internal: So so Brenton, so there is now from twenty eight August to eight to ten days is that somewhere around, uh?;;;

external: Okay.;;;
external: Okay, so we have to wait for that grace period to run.;;;

external: Mhm.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: I mean look, I understand and the path is now clear, I wait until the sixth. and if the card comes in, I then pay which is fine, mm, but just something I get to feedback to your team is whether or not there should be another payment method in case because.;;;
internal: But yeah, sure definitely, yeah.;;;
external: Credit card.;;;

internal: Uh.;;;
external: Um, how does that is that taken out like a direct debit from an account or?;;;

external: Yeah.;;;
internal: It be basically every month, it'll take the money out.;;;

internal: Yeah, that's the cheapest one, we have at the moment.;;;

external: Yeah, alright. and what's involved so if he does want to go ahead if he's happy to change his number, mm, what do you send the Sim out? is that how it works or?;;;
internal: Uh, yeah, yeah. so if the phone if you need a, em, as well, we can do an easy. otherwise, we can send the physical Sim card out.;;;
external: What's an, a, how does that work?;;;
internal: Is more like a bar code where you have to scan for modern phones like new phones. you don't actually need a Sim card. You just have to scan a bar code and it will automatically connect to the network.;;;
external: Oh, what do you scan it with sorry?;;;
internal: Uh, it is through a phone from your phone, you can scan the bar code.;;;
external: Right, so it would have to be from the phone that he's going to use.;;;
internal: Yeah, yeah, yeah, correct.;;;

internal: It didn't need phone, it's not gonna work out, yeah, it's.;;;

internal: W.;;;
external: Sorry, say that again.;;;
internal: W W for whiskey.;;;
external: Yeah, land.;;;

external: Uh.;;;
external: And hmm also, so it says it suggests cause it comes up as two point four and five G.;;;
internal: Yes, uh.;;;
external: So.;;;
internal: That the five G is the fastest one, uh, but five G is working til five metres, but two point four is working ten metres, but it gives you an average speed.;;;
external: So five G works for two meters. Did you say two meters.;;;
internal: Five pietre.;;;
external: Five meter.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Mm.;;;
external: Alright, I've, I've got a Wifi extender as well.;;;

internal: Yes, it will have, yes, it will have.;;;
external: Okay and when we get the, mm, the new connection to the premier.;;;
external: Will will the five G work better then or?;;;
internal: Yes, normally the fibre, the press one is much faster than, uh.;;;
internal: And a stable, uh.;;;
internal: So.;;;
internal: Five two, yeah.;;;
external: Yeah, okay, alright.;;;
internal: But but the distance that.;;;
internal: Wifi five G distance normally from the modem to your Diversity is working five metres if you are using extender, it will increase that rate.;;;
external: The extender will.;;;
internal: Yeah, except the building.;;;
external: Okay, alright, mm, hopefully I can set up the extender if not can, can you guys help me set that up?;;;
internal: Yes, yes, you can do that.;;;

internal: Sure.;;;
internal: It actually depends with those wall. if it is hard wall sometimes it is reducing the signal strength.;;;
internal: Yeah to check.;;;
external: Yeah, okay. no, that's fine. We will play around with it. but as long as I've got some sort of connection so I can can start working, that's good.;;;

internal: Uh.;;;
internal: Bye.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
internal: No.;;;
internal: No, no.;;;
internal: Oh, thank you so much for holding. I checked on your account. so this is actually what's happening, um, we don't have information and I understand that you want to get your upgrade finished as fast as possible.;;;
internal: So I explain as to what's going on so this something there is a concern according to the information that is being shared.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Uh, there's something wrong at the location where maybe it's down the street or nearby, uh, to your premise where they would have some sort of a hat or manhole sort of you know in the underground, its a location which is common to.;;;
internal: Most of the people in the area that the cables are, you know, distributed down the ground in a safe manner so m b m, which is a supply. the infrastructure supply requires that it's managed in a certain way so they would be able to distribute the Internet connection through a conduit.;;;
internal: Or you know like optic cables or splice closes. so what they're doing in that.;;;
internal: You know, small, uh, footprint of a multi port, they're actually trying to work it out to get it up to speed. so that they'll be able to distribute your connection Also. So what they are trying to tell us now. Is that it's not, I think you know, it's not established in a proper way. It's not top of speed at least right now.;;;
internal: And, uh, there would be a set of different teams that would look into that. Uh, they refer to us the mediation team. uh, because they have to fix it then connect your house to the cabling that is being extended from the, to your house boundary. I hope you understand.;;;
internal: I mean if you have any concerns or some sort of ambiguity, I'm more than happy to address that but that's just as to what's going on so further. we have based on a previous call. what we've done is, we have requested because some sort of technical staff has has to, you know, like received that particular location and, uh.;;1;
internal: So if there is some sort of network equipment that is necessary to get that up to speed. They have to order it go and replace it and you know do all that sort of work. They have not given us a test when they would be able to complete it. but we have requested for the previous person. you talked to has requested for, is that particular date?;;;
internal: And if they could, you know, hurry up and do it and give us a date a probable date where they would complete all the work that has not been shared as of yet though.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: The lady you spoke with have requested that on the twenty ninth.;;;
external: So.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: So I was supposed to come your third but.;;;
external: Can you confirm what the service is supposed to be, is, it supposed to be fibre to the curb to the premises Cause it's my understanding, I ordered the premises.;;;
internal: No.;;;
internal: That's correct. So you already have five, uh, huh.;;;
external: And that's.;;;
external: The guys came out two guys came out a couple of weeks ago and physically rang a bit of vote from across the road to my property ready and they said.;;;
external: When the next guy comes out, he will run the actual fibre big cable to my premises, install the boxes and and do all that but then I'm getting emails from you guys saying it can't go ahead until I plug in a network convert connection device and I have to do this or it won't happen.;;;
external: They haven't given me any boxes and I just looked it up and that looks like it's talking about a modem and a router already have a modem and a router for years ago with you guys so.;;;
external: Am I supposed to be getting a new one or I, I'm just worried that if it's waiting on something on my end. I don't have these extra things and it's not.;;;
external: Mm, there's nothing else I can do so I just don't want it to sit there thinking that I need to do something when it's like it said it's up to Mbn to sort out their side first. So I just confused as to what what was happening or if they.;;;
external: If it was only fibre that occurred then that was different to what my understanding was. but if it's yeah to my understanding, it should be fibre premises and some of the messages on the El site. don't clarify that they just say fibre upgrade, so I wasn't sure which one.;;;
internal: Sure.;;;
external: This planned to be.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: I understand where you are coming from, I'll explain it to you. So what you have already using copper cables that to the curb, you have that already. So what you're upgrading to is to the premise. So I'll explain as to the people who came across, uh, they would be a technician and a pres Scoping team.;;1;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: A pre copping team would come and you know like analyse the place to check if everything is in order and a technician would be. so that's just one person. The second person is the technician who would come and install the device, the network termination device that you refer to the M B N device so that's alright, that's at your.;;1;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: The activities at the boundary. so what I was referring to for, they might have connect as in based on the information at hand though you have the devices they have not completed connecting, you know, the cabling or the optical cables coming from the, as in speed to your boundary so.;;;
internal: Technician who had come across, would have to come again. but in order to connect both ends they have to address whatever problem. There is at the peak first after that to they will be able to get you connected.;;1;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
external: Yeah, yeah, it's just that. I've got a text and an email that was telling me. I had to hook up a box and it can't go ahead until that happens And I don't have any. yeah. like you said there should be some boxes in the garage that it all go through and then into the house but I don't have any of that installed. I've only had that one visit with.;;;
external: They haven't even hooked the table up yet. So I was just unsure of what.;;;
internal: You.;;;
external: Yeah, like you said hmm, it's my understanding but another technician has to do that before And obviously it can't hook it up until that.;;1;
external: Gets connected up, but I just wasn't sure what mbn was thinking or planning and I don't tell you how much.;;;
internal: That's alright. Can you tell me if you have the M B M device already installed Is there an M B N device installed? I am not referring to the technology you are supposed to get another device. It's not the white device that you have already. You are supposed to get another device. Do you have that already installed?;;1;
external: What, sorry?;;;
external: No, I don't.;;;
internal: Okay, so that, that's when a technician would come again, uh, that person would come and install that device also. So I'm not referring to the white rectangular like device that you have already. It would be a similar device but it would support fastest speeds. so the technician would come and install a utility box which is.;;1;
external: No.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Outside your ball, but they would also install an internal device also.;;;
internal: So the last after after the remediation is over.;;;
external: Okay, that makes sense, yeah.;;;
internal: After the remediation is over a technician would visit again to install that. but that is only after the problem at the six as in problem at the pet. is, you know, completely done then they will come and connect everything, okay.;;1;
external: Bye.;;;
external: Okay, that makes sense. I just just confused because the, the emails were telling me one thing and yeah.;;;
external: I just wanted to clarify what it was, they were doing and ok, So I've just got to wait for.;;;
internal: Yes, we do.;;;
external: To them to bring another box out hook some other stuff up and then tell you guys that it's good to go. I guess it the day.;;;
internal: Yes, uh, that's what you have to wait for, I'm sorry, but we don't have a date as to when the remediation will be fixed, uh, as of the peak, the problem that the peak time is referring to we have asked for a date from the supplier to give us a date a probable date as to when it would complete only after that we still have.;;;
internal: I have to assign a technician to come across. so we are waiting until that party is finished as soon as that's completed. We will assign a technician to come and install the pre installation devices which are the M B M B M device and the utility box which should come outside your.;;1;
internal: Okay, your home phone.;;;
external: Which is.;;;
external: Thank you.;;;
internal: Anything else I can check for you?;;;
external: Uh, no, not really cause the other thing actually the other thing was the the three months thing. When does that start, does that start when that services started or?;;;
internal: You are referring to your billing, yes, so your connection is pending at the moment, uh, once your service is active only, your billing will start not until that, but you seem to have another connection at your address already That would not be, you know, impacted or affected, uh, I do have to let you know this.;;;
internal: The fibre to the curb service using copper wires. It would discontinue after your Fibre connection is activated. It would not be impacted on a before date.;;;
external: Okay, so and is there something about a speed upgrade or something for a while so does that happen after the?;;;
external: Cause it, I think can you confirm with this fibre to the property that I go to about that two hundred or two fifty?;;;
external: Mm, Is that, that was what I thought I was signing up for was five, the premises and two fifty megabytes speed.;;;
external: Or my.;;;
internal: Okay, yes about the speed, it's like this. if you are requesting for a two hundred and fifty m b speed, uh, we would not be able to as in, it's not feasible over the copper lines. We would only be able to give you that speed after you upgrade your service to fibre to the premises.;;;
external: Computer.;;;
external: Yeah, that's, that's what I thought once that then it'll it'll increase so currently it as it is, it's already a hundred, so its a hundred anyway.;;;
internal: So.;;;
internal: The speed.;;;
internal: Hundred twenty.;;;
internal: Yes, a hundred twenty is the current speed will be able to switch the speed to a much more speed after your upgrade is done. So we are meeting until the problem at the speed is fixed off after that technician would as in follow after the problem at P as in sorted out after the.;;1;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: That we will be able to upgrade your speed as.;;;
external: Okay, thank you.;;;
internal: Sure, alright. Thank you for your call and your time today as well have a good day and if you have something else please give us a call and we will be that help you.;;;

internal: Ok, let me check.;;;
external: The account is active. I've asked before the account is definitely active.;;;
external: But which which hmm, I didn't set this up but the yellow cable that we've got plugged into the wall should be connected to.;;;
external: Ah, the should be in the Lan slot, is that right?;;;
internal: So you have connected with a yellow colour cable.;;;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: Okay, uh, so according to your connection type, it's fibre no connection. So you should be connecting with Dsl cables. They are grey colour cables, not yellow colour.;;;
external: Uh, hang on, ok, wait one second. I have got the box here, hang on.;;;
internal: Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.;;;
external: Okay.;;;

internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Okay, hang on one second. I'm gonna.;;;
external: Connect that.;;;
external: Ok, so I've unplugged the yellow and I'm plugging in the grey in the Dsl.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Okay, so let me know if there's any change like if the broadband light comes lights up, yeah.;;;
external: By.;;;
external: Okay, okay. okay. I plugged it back. So I've just plugged into the wall to the same slot as the yellow cable was in and I've used the Dsl slot on the router.;;;
external: I am waiting, it doesn't.;;;
external: Seem to have brought on any different lights. I've still showing three green which is power two point four G and five G.;;;
internal: So like you have connected the Dsl cable to the Dsl port and the wall socket, right. It should be a different wall socket than the Ethernet cables going.;;;

external: Okay.;;;

external: Will it be, will it stop flashing altogether or will it just flash fast like it is now?;;;
internal: Yes, uh, yeah, so it flashes fast and then, uh, goes solid and then the Internet light lights up, that's the light.;;;
external: Okay, okay. let's, let's wait it's flashing, it's flashing fast now still.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
internal: Because like our routers are pre configured, you don't need to configure it again. You just need to connect it correctly, that's right.;;;

internal: Everything seems to be in place there seems to be an active service on the property. So should be the current tenant. So the activation date needs to be the first of September, right.;;;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: So do you want the current service address services that are cancelled on the first or is there an overlap for you?;;;
external: Hmm, make making an overlap please.;;;

internal: Second.;;;
external: So.;;;
external: Uh, the second of September.;;;
internal: September, no worries. I'll get that done.;;;
internal: Okay, right. so with the relocation of the service, Do you want to relocate with the same speed that you're on or do you want to consider a different plan?;;;
external: I'm considering a different plan, uh, cause I, I don't think we use, you know, we fully used the services. you guys provide at the current, hmm price to.;;;
internal: Okay, which do you want to go with?;;;
internal: Okay, okay. so you're looking for a cheaper and a slower speed plan or cheaper, okay. So currently on the hundred by forty, uh, so the next plan down would be hundred by twenty, that is sixty nine for the first six months after that. It'll be eighty five and the plan below that is fifty by twenty that is fifty nine for the first six months.;;;
external: Yeah, yeah, yeah.;;;
internal: As well, it will be seventy five.;;;
internal: So it's a small different eighty five, uh, so I would recommend at least stick to the fifty by when you can ask you, what do you usually use your Internet for?;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
external: Hmm, only for, you know, website and.;;;
external: Yeah, maybe, uh, after I moved in, I would probably use kind of network streaming services.;;;
internal: Ok, right. so you norm work from home, yeah.;;;
external: I work from home but it's not love. It's just, you know, not that.;;;
internal: It's not a lot right, right. No worries. understand. so let's go in then fifty by twenty cause that'll be the ideal speeds for you. so which is fifty nine for the first six months after that. It'll be seventy five, would that be fine or is that too slow speed?;;;
external: Yeah, I think it will be fine, Let's try and after that, can we can I just upgrade if it's not?;;;
internal: It will be fine.;;;
internal: Yeah, you can, but yeah, sure, sure, no worries. But keep in mind if you do any changes within the first six months period, you lose your promotional pricing so I would recommend for you to stick to apply for the first six months so fifty by when he should do it for you or do you think the speed might not be enough?;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: I think, hmm, I think we will be fine.;;;
internal: It will be fine, okay, no worries. So I do have to research a member's portal pass. So I can get the new account added in. Could you verify me your email address please?;;;
external: Uh, of course, it's J I N Q.;;;

external: Hmm, alright, aside from that, um, he'd probably only be looking at the sixteen dollar prepaid plan cause he doesn't use the Internet or anything, so that's just calls and messages.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: Um, how does that is that taken out like a direct debit from an account or?;;;
internal: Yeah, that's correct. So we need to give a detail direct debit debit for mobile plans. It has to be a credit card. So you can either give a credit card or the debit card and it will have a monthly bill basically so you can put an auto recharge if you want to, but otherwise it's a monthly cost.;;;
external: Yeah, okay.;;;
external: Right, okay.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: It be basically every month, it'll take the money out.;;;
external: Right, okay and that's the only charges, the sixteen dollars a month.;;;
internal: Yeah, yeah, yeah, additionally as I said if if the person is user if he uses a lot of data and everything, he can keep that auto recharge on but otherwise it's sixty.;;;
external: Yes.;;;
external: No not.;;;
external: Yeah, no, no, it doesn't use any data at all. Just just the phone. I guess that's the cheapest price, isn't it that one?;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: Yeah, that's the cheapest one, we have at the moment.;;;
external: Yes.;;;
external: Yeah, alright. and what's involved so if he does want to go ahead if he's happy to change his number, mm, what do you send the Sim out? is that how it works or?;;;
internal: Uh, yeah, yeah. so if the phone if you need a, em, as well, we can do an easy. otherwise, we can send the physical Sim card out.;;;
external: What's an, a, how does that work?;;;
internal: Is more like a bar code where you have to scan for modern phones like new phones. you don't actually need a Sim card. You just have to scan a bar code and it will automatically connect to the network.;;;
external: Oh, what do you scan it with sorry?;;;
internal: Uh, it is through a phone from your phone, you can scan the bar code.;;;
external: Right, so it would have to be from the phone that he's going to use.;;;
internal: Yeah, yeah, yeah, correct.;;;
external: Right, he's only getting like a cheap Nokia flip file. So I'm not sure whether.;;;
internal: It didn't need phone, it's not gonna work out, yeah, it's.;;;
external: It won't work, no, okay. so it would have to be a physical Sim and they're not hard to insert, are they?;;;
internal: Yeah, if you be a simple.;;;
internal: No, no, no, no, not at all. No, the Sim has all the Sim cards sizes so it.;;;
external: No, yeah, alright.;;;
external: Yeah, alright. alright. I'll, I'll check with him about the phone number. I'm not sure whether Telstra can re it. if it's, if they can issue it either then I'll come back to you guys.;;;

internal: So if there is some sort of network equipment that is necessary to get that up to speed. They have to order it go and replace it and you know do all that sort of work. They have not given us a test when they would be able to complete it. but we have requested for the previous person. you talked to has requested for, is that particular date?;;;
internal: And if they could, you know, hurry up and do it and give us a date a probable date where they would complete all the work that has not been shared as of yet though.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: The lady you spoke with have requested that on the twenty ninth.;;;
external: So.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: So I was supposed to come your third but.;;;
external: Can you confirm what the service is supposed to be, is, it supposed to be fibre to the curb to the premises Cause it's my understanding, I ordered the premises.;;;
internal: No.;;;
internal: That's correct. So you already have five, uh, huh.;;;
external: And that's.;;;
external: The guys came out two guys came out a couple of weeks ago and physically rang a bit of vote from across the road to my property ready and they said.;;;
external: When the next guy comes out, he will run the actual fibre big cable to my premises, install the boxes and and do all that but then I'm getting emails from you guys saying it can't go ahead until I plug in a network convert connection device and I have to do this or it won't happen.;;;
external: They haven't given me any boxes and I just looked it up and that looks like it's talking about a modem and a router already have a modem and a router for years ago with you guys so.;;;
external: Am I supposed to be getting a new one or I, I'm just worried that if it's waiting on something on my end. I don't have these extra things and it's not.;;;
external: Mm, there's nothing else I can do so I just don't want it to sit there thinking that I need to do something when it's like it said it's up to Mbn to sort out their side first. So I just confused as to what what was happening or if they.;;;
external: If it was only fibre that occurred then that was different to what my understanding was. but if it's yeah to my understanding, it should be fibre premises and some of the messages on the El site. don't clarify that they just say fibre upgrade, so I wasn't sure which one.;;;
internal: Sure.;;;
external: This planned to be.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: I understand where you are coming from, I'll explain it to you. So what you have already using copper cables that to the curb, you have that already. So what you're upgrading to is to the premise. So I'll explain as to the people who came across, uh, they would be a technician and a pres Scoping team.;;1;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: A pre copping team would come and you know like analyse the place to check if everything is in order and a technician would be. so that's just one person. The second person is the technician who would come and install the device, the network termination device that you refer to the M B N device so that's alright, that's at your.;;1;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: The activities at the boundary. so what I was referring to for, they might have connect as in based on the information at hand though you have the devices they have not completed connecting, you know, the cabling or the optical cables coming from the, as in speed to your boundary so.;;;
internal: Technician who had come across, would have to come again. but in order to connect both ends they have to address whatever problem. There is at the peak first after that to they will be able to get you connected.;;1;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
external: Yeah, yeah, it's just that. I've got a text and an email that was telling me. I had to hook up a box and it can't go ahead until that happens And I don't have any. yeah. like you said there should be some boxes in the garage that it all go through and then into the house but I don't have any of that installed. I've only had that one visit with.;;;
external: They haven't even hooked the table up yet. So I was just unsure of what.;;;
internal: You.;;;
external: Yeah, like you said hmm, it's my understanding but another technician has to do that before And obviously it can't hook it up until that.;;1;
external: Gets connected up, but I just wasn't sure what mbn was thinking or planning and I don't tell you how much.;;;
internal: That's alright. Can you tell me if you have the M B M device already installed Is there an M B N device installed? I am not referring to the technology you are supposed to get another device. It's not the white device that you have already. You are supposed to get another device. Do you have that already installed?;;1;
external: What, sorry?;;;
external: No, I don't.;;;
internal: Okay, so that, that's when a technician would come again, uh, that person would come and install that device also. So I'm not referring to the white rectangular like device that you have already. It would be a similar device but it would support fastest speeds. so the technician would come and install a utility box which is.;;1;
external: No.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Outside your ball, but they would also install an internal device also.;;;
internal: So the last after after the remediation is over.;;;
external: Okay, that makes sense, yeah.;;;
internal: After the remediation is over a technician would visit again to install that. but that is only after the problem at the six as in problem at the pet. is, you know, completely done then they will come and connect everything, okay.;;1;
external: Bye.;;;
external: Okay, that makes sense. I just just confused because the, the emails were telling me one thing and yeah.;;;
external: I just wanted to clarify what it was, they were doing and ok, So I've just got to wait for.;;;
internal: Yes, we do.;;;
external: To them to bring another box out hook some other stuff up and then tell you guys that it's good to go. I guess it the day.;;;
internal: Yes, uh, that's what you have to wait for, I'm sorry, but we don't have a date as to when the remediation will be fixed, uh, as of the peak, the problem that the peak time is referring to we have asked for a date from the supplier to give us a date a probable date as to when it would complete only after that we still have.;;;
internal: I have to assign a technician to come across. so we are waiting until that party is finished as soon as that's completed. We will assign a technician to come and install the pre installation devices which are the M B M B M device and the utility box which should come outside your.;;1;
internal: Okay, your home phone.;;;
external: Which is.;;;
external: Thank you.;;;
internal: Anything else I can check for you?;;;
external: Uh, no, not really cause the other thing actually the other thing was the the three months thing. When does that start, does that start when that services started or?;;;
internal: You are referring to your billing, yes, so your connection is pending at the moment, uh, once your service is active only, your billing will start not until that, but you seem to have another connection at your address already That would not be, you know, impacted or affected, uh, I do have to let you know this.;;;
internal: The fibre to the curb service using copper wires. It would discontinue after your Fibre connection is activated. It would not be impacted on a before date.;;;
external: Okay, so and is there something about a speed upgrade or something for a while so does that happen after the?;;;
external: Cause it, I think can you confirm with this fibre to the property that I go to about that two hundred or two fifty?;;;
external: Mm, Is that, that was what I thought I was signing up for was five, the premises and two fifty megabytes speed.;;;
external: Or my.;;;
internal: Okay, yes about the speed, it's like this. if you are requesting for a two hundred and fifty m b speed, uh, we would not be able to as in, it's not feasible over the copper lines. We would only be able to give you that speed after you upgrade your service to fibre to the premises.;;;
external: Computer.;;;
external: Yeah, that's, that's what I thought once that then it'll it'll increase so currently it as it is, it's already a hundred, so its a hundred anyway.;;;
internal: So.;;;
internal: The speed.;;;
internal: Hundred twenty.;;;
internal: Yes, a hundred twenty is the current speed will be able to switch the speed to a much more speed after your upgrade is done. So we are meeting until the problem at the speed is fixed off after that technician would as in follow after the problem at P as in sorted out after the.;;1;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: That we will be able to upgrade your speed as.;;;
external: Okay, thank you.;;;
internal: Sure, alright. Thank you for your call and your time today as well have a good day and if you have something else please give us a call and we will be that help you.;;;

external: Uh, I've got ninety nine point seven two gigabytes of data out of a hundred gigabytes, mm, then when I only got to bill the other day last week. so it's only recent so but I mean my good morning homepage.;;;

internal: Apply for the service.;;;

I've been, I've been with you guys for a million years and I've also been with Vodafone since I think our first mobile phones came out but mm, I'm just not getting the reception. I've been away a few times, particularly lately to the country And I've been down to mm, King Ireland of Tasmania and that and I'm.;;;

external: Yes, hi, good morning. Uh, I'm struggling to, I've just moved house and I've just had a connection made yesterday and I'm struggling to go through the wizard.;;;
internal: I.;;;
external: Well.;;;
internal: I see alright, I should be able to guide you on this.;;;
external: Yeah, just to say, um, I'm putting in the, uh, username.;;;
internal: Huh.;;;
external: And the password.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: That was sent to me on my, on my mobile.;;;
internal: Yes, uh.;;;
external: And it doesn't been fixed because it says invalid username invalid pass.;;;
external: Password.;;;
internal: Alright, are you using this to, uh, log into the gateway or is this the P bpo username that you're entering.;;;
external: It just says sign in.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: You know, it says sign in.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Uh, uh, so if.;;;
external: Shall I go back?;;;
external: And I, I put in the details. I was sent on the, on my mobile in sign in.;;;
external: But when I try and press the signing button, it goes to verifying and then.;;;
external: It just says.;;;
external: Invalid username or password.;;;
internal: I see alright so.;;;
external: And I have to do five or six times. So I'm, I'm, you know, pretty sure I'm being.;;;
internal: I see.;;;
external: I used my question is I was an existing user. Do I use the user name and password. I've always had for the whole system. All the ones that were sent to me a couple of days ago.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
internal: Ah, so I would actually have to check on this to see what was the user name that you entered, is it, the service number at the state?;;;
external: At at q dot it dot com dot a u.;;;
internal: I see so this is actually your P Ppo user name. This is what actually connects the modem to the Internet and, uh, but are you using this to log into the modem so these are two different logins actually.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah, well, I, you know as I say it's a new connection.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
external: Em, it hasn't worked yet. I haven't got it to work.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
external: Um.;;;
external: Hmm, I did phone technical sports support earlier and there was a, the Ethernet cable was in the wrong port for my modem from the outlet. so we got that right.;;1;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
external: And that step forward but it looks like it's not configured in that. so that's what I'm trying to do.;;;
internal: Our.;;;
internal: Alright, you know, what, let's, let's quickly get to the account. so that I can get an idea on what exactly the issue is, uh, so.;;;
external: I agree with that.;;;
internal: Yes, so we would have to go through the verification once again. Would you happen to have the customer Id or maybe the mobile number that's been shared with us?;;;
external: Yes, my mobile number is zero four nine.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
external: O nine six.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Number zero three five nine.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
external: No, I'm just think about that. I'm cus because I've been at this for four days now and moving house is just two months. Let me go through that. my number is o four nine.;;;
internal: That.;;;
internal: I see.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
external: O nine six o three five nine.;;;
internal: Alright, thank you. and can I also have your full name, email address and your new service address?;;;
external: Okay, so my full name is Terence, T E R E N C E Terence, Con, C O double n o, double L Y.;;;
external: And, um, I at what else did you want?;;;
internal: Uh, your email address and the service address?;;;
external: Okay, my email address is tray, which is t e double r o double l y at i i net.;;;
external: Dot net dot a U.;;;
internal: Alright and your service address Terence?;;;
external: I'm unit fifty six at fifty four Og Road runs for five o three.;;;
internal: Alright, thanks Tern and I've also just sent you a verification code to your mobile Once again. Do you think you could give me this code?;;;
external: Okay, hold on one moment please.;;;
internal: Sure.;;;
external: The La code is three eight.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
external: One three eight.;;;
internal: Alright, yes, thank you Terence and, uh, I can see that you've called us about half an hour ago.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: So hmm, let me check real quick alright. so it is an Iinet modem, correct?;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: I see so.;;;
internal: Uh, would you happen to have the model with you, uh, the model of this modem so that I could also grab set up guide from my end and then help you with the set up wizard.;;;
external: I haven't been able to find a model number on it or on the or on the handbook. I know you're looking for a number but I have you know to find it anywhere.;;;
internal: I see have you checked at the back of the modem, there could be a sticker on it with the model lander.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah, there is a stick up and let me got have another look. It's in the bedroom. I'll have another look quickly just stay with me and I, I tried for the other feller really, I just couldn't find the last number.;;;
external: But anyway it's.;;;
external: A bit more at this.;;;
internal: I see.;;;
internal: So Iinet normally uses hmm.;;;
internal: Uh, technical or net gear modems, so I'm just.;;1;
external: It's a technic cover.;;1;
internal: Technical.;;1;
external: This is, yeah.;;;
external: Got it on the top.;;;
internal: Alright, p p g seven eight nine.;;;
external: Uh.;;;
external: It does just say t g iinet dash one.;;;
internal: Lets see.;;;
external: I've got a.;;;
external: I've got a, a serial number.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
external: And I've got a Mac number.;;;
external: The G w number.;;;
internal: I see the g w is the one, the gateway, that's the one you used to get to the set up wizard, yeah.;;;
external: No, well, this one, I'm looking at the, the sticker that's on on the.;;;
external: Em, on the Iinet router and it's, it's, you know it says.;;;
external: B A T G I I net dot I V I.;;;
internal: I see.;;;
internal: See.;;;
internal: That's fine. Let's, uh, do you also see a user name and a password there which says in most cases, it's admin and then password these ones.;;;
external: Yesterday.;;;
external: It's admin, the pass, the user name is admin and the password is admin.;;;
internal: Admin, yes, so that's the one you need to enter, uh, huh.;;;
external: That she used.;;;
external: Oh, is that what I got into?;;;
internal: Is that the one you use to get into the set up?;;;
external: No, I didn't no, I used. I'm trying. I've been trying to use the one that they sent me, uh, you know the, the ten digit code and the.;;;
internal: Yes so.;;;
internal: Yes, so that's actually to be used when you log after you log into the modem, uh, terrace. I'll guide you on where you can find that so to log into the modem to log into the gateway. You need to use these passwords admin and admin.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Ok, I want to do that right now. I'm just giving you the other one.;;;
internal: I'm sure, it's all lower case.;;;
external: Okay, admin, admin, I go to sign in.;;;
external: Verifying.;;;
external: Invalid user name or password.;;;
internal: Mm.;;;
internal: You typed it, all in lower case, yeah.;;;
external: It's in lower, yeah.;;;
internal: Let's see.;;;
internal: Hmm, it would be a lot easier if he could find what the model is because there's actually a few models from technical there is.;;1;
internal: Smart Gen two and, uh, t g seven eight nine.;;;
external: The, it's got, uh.;;;
external: You know, it's got helpful, you've got the lights, it's square.;;;
internal: Uh, huh.;;;
external: And it's it's square edges, it's not a rounded s.;;;
internal: It's, it doesn't have round digs.;;;
external: No.;;;
internal: I see so the T G seven eight nine, actually has around, I has round digits and, uh.;;;
internal: And there are like tiny holes on top.;;;
external: Yes, it's got a like a G on top.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: But this has got edges on this so.;;;
internal: So when you get to the log in page, does it come up with, uh, uh, Orange buttons to cancel and sign in?;;;
external: I.;;;
internal: The buttons are they, no, are they orange in colour?;;;
external: You mean on on the, em.;;;
internal: The sign in page where you.;;;
external: Yes.;;;
internal: Entered admin and admin.;;;
external: Okay, I'm in the bedroom going back to the garage.;;;
external: Yeah, the Orange box.;;;
internal: I see.;;;
external: Thank.;;;
internal: Alright Terence, are you doing this on, uh, your computer or your mobile?;;;
external: My computer.;;;
internal: Alright, so what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna send you a link there to this is actually an application that we have developed called I and it, let's see you share a live video and then I can guide you step by step. Can we give it a try?;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Yes, that sounds good monkey C monkey, do, huh.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: But I have to tell you Terence, we actually not professionally trained on third party modems but I'm going to certainly try and.;;;
external: Okay, anything to get this guy.;;;
internal: Yes, if not, you would actually have to check with the previous provider to see if the modem is locked by any chance.;;;
external: Well, I've always, it's always been it. I've been a customer for five years now.;;;
internal: Yes, because some service providers, they actually lock their modems to their service. So when you, uh, move on to another provider, you have to actually request them to unlock the modem for you. So let's just hope that it's not one of those instances.;;;
external: I.;;;
internal: Uh, yeah.;;;
external: Yes.;;;
external: So I'm talking to extra at the moment.;;;
internal: Yes, yes Terra, you are with.;;;
external: Yeah, that's what I've got five years I painted.;;;
internal: Yes, so I can see that you were with us since twenty eighteen. Were you using the same modem?;;;
external: Same modem here.;;;
internal: I see.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
internal: Alright, so I've just sent you a text terra to your mobile with a link.;;;
external: Okay, let me have a look.;;;
external: Yeah, I'll see the link.;;;
internal: Yes, you click on the link and then it will give you the option to share a live video.;;;
external: Okay, I've done just loading up.;;;
external: Welcome to the X web portal.;;;
external: I got to the line video.;;;
internal: Yes, click on Live video.;;;
external: Says go back.;;;
external: It says off.;;;
internal: There should be an option to choose allowed.;;;
external: It's also allow, yes, I can, I allow there we are.;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
external: I've got a message from Samsung Internet to.;;;
external: Uh, to take pictures and record video while using the app, is it?;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
internal: Yes, yes, that's what actually lets us. Let me see the live video from my end.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Alright, I am going to accept it from my end now.;;;
external: But it.;;;
external: It's got, it's given me a key number which has got now.;;;
internal: Yes, that's fine. I've got the key. alright. yes, I can see your laptop now, alrighty. so this is the sign in page that's right.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: So according to, uh, what I found on the set up guide, it is actually admin an admin, but you.;;;
internal: Hmm, is it the same, that's at the back of the Iinet modem?;;;
external: Yes, it is, it's a admin admin, it is, yes.;;;
internal: Terrace.;;;
internal: Alright, so if that is the case, would you happen to remember the last time that you had to do this? This was, I'm sure this was a long time ago when you were the last, uh, address, uh, because some modems when you enter the default user name and the password which is admin address.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Admin, it prompts you to change the password.;;;
internal: Would you happen to remember if you changed the password?;;;
external: Well, if it shall I, I, I can't be sure because my son did it, but I could, I know what password is written down here, I could use it.;;;
internal: Yes, but it's not the one. we sent you not this, uh, username.;;;
external: No, no, it's my password.;;;
internal: Alright, you could give it a try.;;;
external: I'll try that hang on.;;;
external: I got to sign in.;;;
internal: Let's see if it works.;;;
internal: Invalid username or password I see.;;;
internal: So, uh, so if that is the case we would have to do a factory reset on the modem Terrance.;;;
external: Like a.;;;
internal: Uh, yes, so can we go back to the modem? You might need a pin, you might need a paper clip or because there is a tiny pin hole at the back of the modem which we need to insert a pin on.;;;
external: Wife.;;;
external: Yeah, okay.;;;
internal: Grab a pin.;;;
external: Okay, okay, just.;;;
external: Paper C.;;;
external: Okay, I'll set up.;;;
internal: Yes, so at the back where all the cables I lost the issue but, uh, that's fine, uh.;;;
external: I've lock room.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: You might have to go to the link, but do you see a reset Pinole Terrace?;;;
external: Would it be on the, at the back?;;;
internal: It's yes, it will be at the back where the cable or the cables are.;;;
external: Yes, I.;;;
external: I'll see it.;;;
internal: Yes, so you, you can insert the pin, hold it down for a few seconds and then you notice all the lights going off the power light might stay on, but the rest would go off.;;;
internal: After that you can take the pin out.;;;
external: That maybe I not in the right now.;;;
external: Yeah, she's, she's resetting.;;;
internal: Yes, the reset, not the power button or the Wifi button, it's the reset its, a pin hole.;;;
external: Okay, well.;;;
external: Ok, just the power, just the power light has stayed on.;;;
internal: Alright, you can take the pin out.;;;
external: Okay on all like.;;;
internal: Yes, uh.;;;
internal: So while you are there, you can actually double check the default user name and the password whether they are both admin and admin.;;;
external: Username admin, password admin.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
internal: Alright and they are all lower case, yeah.;;;
external: All lower cases.;;;
internal: Alright, so once the lights are back on, let's go back to your computer.;;;
internal: And, uh, put in admin and admin again because the reason we did the reset is if the password had to be changed, last time manually. This would reset that and set it to the default credentials so.;;;
external: Yeah, okay. So I'm actually, I'm still in the bedroom and it's just the status light, the power light that's flashing on and off the light doesn't come on.;;;
internal: Alright, em, let's see.;;;
internal: This could take about two to three minutes but, uh, is the Wifi light on, Do you have a Wifi light on this?;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: I've got a wire, that's not on the none of the green lights are on.;;;
internal: Alright, can we, can you share the video once again, Can you go back to the link?;;;
external: Ok, let's do that.;;;
internal: Alright, I have received the request im going.;;;
internal: Alright, yes, I can see that now so the van light and the other lights will come on the wireless light should be on.;;;
internal: Not, so if it takes a bit longer.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Yeah, you didn't remove any of the cables, right, Terra.;;;
external: So all the cables are the there.;;;
internal: Plug.;;;
internal: That's right, is it tightly fied in ye?;;;
external: There is a reset button at the back as well, if maybe you could do that.;;;
internal: Hmm, that would be the power button, I believe it.;;;
external: Yes, but but it it, I often s do this sort of stuff, sit often starting.;;;
internal: There anyway, this should come up in a bit. It seems like it's taking a bit longer.;;;
external: Hi here, we got this wireless, is there?;;;
internal: Yes and, uh.;;;
internal: At the moment, the van light will come on as well, but that's fine as long as we have the, uh.;;;
internal: Wireless light, we can go back to your laptop.;;;
external: Okay, bye, bye.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
internal: Alright, let's refresh the page and it seems like you've disconnected from the Wifi, so let's connect you back to the Wifi.;;;
internal: You see the tiny globe down there onto your right?;;;
internal: Where you connect to the Wifi?;;;
external: Well on the computer.;;;
internal: Yes, on the computer, you are currently disconnected so you have to.;;;
internal: Yes, click on that the one that says yea, that is the one.;;;
external: Oh, okay, yeah.;;;
internal: And we will once again have to connect to the Iinet modem.;;;
external: Enter the network security key.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
internal: Uh, the default Wifi password that's, uh, did you have?;;;
external: Yes, I've got that. I've got that person down, I think somewhere.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
external: Can I put that in?;;;
internal: Yes, you can put that in.;;;
external: Six.;;;
external: Verifying and connecting.;;;
internal: Mhm.;;;
internal: It will say connected without Internet or connected but no Internet.;;;
external: It's, it's just, I, it here, we go.;;;
external: Your Internet connection is currently down, you can try the following.;;;
internal: Can you show me what it shows?;;;
external: Can you see on the screen?;;;
internal: Hmm, I can see you Terra, I think you've flipped the camera.;;;
external: What.;;;
external: Oh, sorry, what happen do do.;;;
internal: Yes, uh, can you show me the Wifi status once again on whether you are connected to the Wifi where you had the globe before?;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: No Internet secured.;;;
internal: I'm seeing you once again terrace.;;;
external: Oh, shit, that's going.;;;
external: Oh, what's going on.;;;
external: Oh, oh, I must this way, is that what?;;;
internal: Alright, yes, there you go, yeah.;;;
external: Worry about it.;;;
internal: There, you go, let me see.;;;
internal: Yes, no Internet secured, that's correct now. uh, what does it say on the screen, uh?;;;
internal: Sure.;;;
internal: Oh.;;;
internal: Yes restart.;;;
external: Is the Internet connection is currently down, you can try to following check that your Ethernet cable is firmly connected to the correct port on your gateway.;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
external: Or the Internet socket in the wall?;;;
internal: Yes, we are trying the second one, we are restarting the gateway. so you could put in the same address that you put in before.;;;
external: Without I put that in.;;;
internal: Eh, to get to the sign in page to the log in page before.;;;
external: Uh, well, I'm not too sure how to do that. it doesn't take, it doesn't give me any button button here.;;;
internal: Hmm, you could click on refresh on the browser on the top left.;;;
internal: You see the refresh button.;;;
internal: Just under that.;;;
external: It's log in.;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
internal: Uh, the one next to it.;;;
internal: That's back, uh.;;;
internal: The one before that the one that looks like, yes, that's the one.;;;
external: Reload the page, ok.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Sky.;;;
internal: Comes up with the same one, Can we go to the other tab terrace, the first step where you had log in?;;;
internal: So.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Yea, that is the one.;;;
internal: Yes, let's.;;;
external: Oh, there we go.;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
internal: Let's refresh this page first.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
internal: Yep and then.;;;
internal: Yes now let's put in admin and admin.;;;
external: And sign in.;;;
external: Vey.;;;
internal: This looks promising.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Um.;;;
internal: Alright, it seems like we've disconnected from the Wifi once again. Can you see, uh, below where you had the globe?;;;
internal: Let's see if it, alright. it actually did come up alright, that's fine, that's fine. We could just leave it as it is.;;;
internal: And then go back.;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
internal: What do we see, can you show me what it shows?;;;
internal: Set up with it.;;;
external: Now got.;;;
external: Is it?;;;
internal: Brilliant, so on the Internet service provider, click on the drop down arrow.;;;
internal: It's not iinet, you need to select other.;;;
internal: Do you see other?;;;
internal: I cannot see the screen.;;;
external: Is not.;;;
external: It says there there is not other.;;;
internal: Let's see.;;;
internal: What.;;;
external: I, I net, I, I, there's only four options iinet West Net Transac, Adam Internet en mode.;;;
internal: I see.;;;
internal: That's gonna be a problem but you said that you used the same modem at the last location, yeah.;;;
external: Yes, yes, I've been using it from the start five years ago. I've never changed it, the original one.;;;
internal: I see.;;;
internal: I see alright, so let's go ahead with Iinet. You don't happen to remember which option you took right because normally on other modems, you get the other option.;;;
external: Ah, yeah.;;;
internal: Alright, that's fine, uh.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Let's go ahead with Iinet and see and, uh, when interfaces its Ethernet, yes, that's correct.;;;
internal: And when type should be changed.;;;
internal: P p p over eat, yep, that's right.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: And this is where you enter the username and the password we sent to you, uh, Terence.;;;
external: Okay, well, it's, it's offering me this one, this drop down which is.;;;
internal: Let me check that could be the old one.;;;
external: That's the, that's the original one.;;;
internal: Yes, that's not the one you need to enter.;;;
external: No, I must.;;;
internal: Do you want me to send you the text once again?;;;
external: Now I've got it written down, so I can, uh.;;;
external: Put that one in there and just changed a couple of numbers that were change also.;;;
internal: Yes, that's right.;;;
external: O seven o seven nine one eight.;;;
external: Now.;;;
external: Seven one eight, eh.;;;
external: One three nine one four.;;;
external: Excellent, okay, that try just check what one eight one four, yeah. And then the password, I put in the one, they gave me.;;;
internal: Yes, the one that starts with an upper case E for elephant.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yes, that's right.;;;
external: And then it goes D H.;;;
external: And then the next digit is either a capital o or a zero. I think it's zero.;;;
internal: It's, it's actually a zero, it's actually a zero.;;;
external: Right, I thanks and then a N G A.;;;
internal: N G A, that's correct.;;;
external: Okay, I got that go to next.;;;
external: And then we go to step two which is v P net, I don't have Vp. so I just go next.;;;
internal: Let me check, yes, that's right.;;;
external: A Vip.;;;
external: Now we're at step three for the Wifi setup, the wifi's on and the S S I D broadcast is on.;;;
internal: Alright, yes, that's fine.;;;
internal: And that's your Wifi name, yes, that's fine, click on next.;;;
external: Oh, jeez again.;;;
external: Come back.;;;
external: We didn't go away.;;;
internal: Yeah, that's I was thinking.;;;
internal: See.;;;
internal: Let me see, I'm going to see if I could.;;;
internal: Yeah, so the setup wasn't complete.;;;
internal: Can we go back to, uh, the set up is, I think it's at the top.;;;
internal: Hmm, no on on the main screen when you scroll up a bit, you see two buttons onto your top, right?;;;
external: Thank.;;;
internal: Yeah, there you go.;;;
external: Oh, yeah, set up, yeah, yeah.;;;
internal: I think we'll have to go from scratch because we can apply the settings for some reason.;;;
external: Ok, well, we happy with Iinet as a service provider.;;;
internal: Yes, we could use that. since there is no other option.;;;
external: We have to.;;;
external: Eh, we happy with Internet as the one interface.;;;
internal: Yes, when type should be pp over Internet.;;;
external: And we happy with pp over Internet.;;;
external: I've put the username in.;;;
external: When that came on the email.;;;
internal: The what?;;;
internal: Yes, the one that ends with nine one four, I can see that it is already there.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Let's see, oh, seven, oh, one eight.;;;
internal: Yes, that's right. and, uh, let's put in the password once again Terence.;;;
external: Right that temper shift E.;;;
external: D A K.;;;
external: Zero.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: Yeah, I think.;;;
external: I dont have Vip work can go next.;;;
internal: Yes, I think you can click on, I don't have a Vip button there.;;;
external: Then we go next.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: That's all good.;;;
internal: That's the five G I believe.;;;
internal: The two point four alright, click on next.;;;
internal: Oh, it just goes away.;;;
external: Yeah, it's the second time, it's done it.;;;
internal: That's strange.;;;
external: I don't that that.;;;
internal: Um.;;;
internal: Let's see.;;;
internal: Still hasn't authenticated the modem hasn't been configured yet. I'm not sure what's causing this. It could be an issue on the modem too, but you said that you were using the same modem previously.;;;
external: Yes, yes on Friday. I used it. I used it quite, you know, caught up on everything. I did quite a bit on it and then it just switched off.;;;
internal: Uh.;;;
internal: Uh, um.;;;
external: Just switched it off and brought it up, yeah.;;;
internal: I see.;;;
internal: Mm.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Strange, why it doesn't, uh.;;;
internal: Let you, em.;;;
internal: Configure the modem.;;;
internal: See, uh.;;;
internal: Mm.;;;
internal: It seems like there is an issue with the configuration Terence and, uh.;;;
internal: It would actually be a lot easier because I mean this modem. I mean did you buy this modem before you joined us Terrace.;;;
external: This modem.;;;
external: Uh.;;;
external: I can't remember what, what do you mean I buy it.;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
internal: Hmm, so did you get this when you were with Iinet, I mean before you joined Exeter.;;;
external: Um.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yes, yes, I right from the beginning five years. This is the only equipment I've had.;;;
internal: Alright, so this Iinet modem was not provided by exit right.;;;
external: And, uh.;;;
external: My son set it up for me five years ago. I can't remember how it came about that.;;;
internal: I see so.;;;
external: But he he also uses ex hotels, He's got several, uh, systems.;;;
internal: I see alright. so this modem was actually not sent out by us. but, uh, so the reason is Terence. We, I'm not sure what the exact issue is but I can see that it's a matter of just applying the settings, but it wouldn't let you apply the settings.;;;
external: Uh, as you see all step for.;;;
internal: So.;;;
internal: Yeah, yeah, that's right, so it.;;;
internal: Yeah, it could be an issue with the modem so, uh.;;;
internal: Uh, what I could do from my end is since I actually do not have access to your modem remotely. What I could do is if you're happy to go ahead. I could, I mean we send out a new modem, uh, it's actually a brand new modem and, uh, I could actually check with a management to arrange a fifty.;;;
internal: There was a discount on it. If you're happy to go ahead because from my end. I cannot, this is actually the best, we can do to configure a third party modem.;;;
external: Uh, huh, what would that cost?;;;
internal: Um.;;;
internal: Eh, so the original cost is a hundred and forty dollars, so fifty percent off that would be seventy dollars.;;;
external: Uh.;;;
internal: Can I arrange that?;;;
external: Pretty.;;;
external: Pretty heavy, isn't it, um?;;;
external: What?;;;
external: Change not have to do that, uh.;;;
external: But if you feel like anyway around it then I'll have to do it. I'm forced to do it it I.;;;
internal: Eh, so.;;;
internal: Uh, the, the modem we send, you is basically just plug in place. so the modem is pre configured. so it's basically just plug and play which is why we normally suggest unless I mean if there is an issue on third party modems we cannot actually remotely log into it since we do not have access to it.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Hmm, so if you're happy to go ahead.;;;
external: Alright, thank.;;;
external: I think, yes, I think you know, say makes sense to me. so I think we're gonna have to do that, yes.;;;
internal: I could.;;;
internal: Yes, because this modem is actually an old modem that is no longer with Iinet. I mean even Iinet does not send out this modem anymore. And it is possible that the modem has degraded over time. So it seems like it is a modem issue, but I can certainly.;;;
external: Uh, huh.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Check with a management to get a fifty percent discount if you're happy to go ahead with that, uh, clearance.;;;
external: Yeah, yeah, yes please.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
external: Oh.;;;
external: So how long is that gonna take?;;;
internal: Yes so.;;;
internal: Uh, that to be honest, let me check. it normally takes about three to five days to be honest to be.;;;
external: Oh shit, yeah.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: And.;;;
internal: Would you happen to have an alternative modem with you maybe with your son or something that you could use for now or?;;;
external: That I, I don't know, I'd have to ask him if he's got anything.;;;
external: Um.;;;
internal: I see.;;;
internal: Because it's just a matter of applying the settings on the modem which we actually unable to do from our end.;;;
internal: The settings have to be applied on your end, but it wouldn't let you apply the settings for some reason.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: So whatever modem I, I substitute this one with I still use those thing to username and password numbers.;;;
internal: Yes, so if you, if you want to go ahead with another third party modem, you could do the same login to the modem like you did now And then it's just a matter of putting in the username and the password, we sent you, that's what actually connects the modem with Tex Internet so.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Ok.;;;
external: Alright, well, I think we have actually have an alternative. I must go ahead with what you suggesting.;;;
internal: Yes, you could try that too and just make sure that it's an unlocked modem, uh.;;;
external: Well, I'm gonna only use the one you send me.;;;
internal: Alright, alright. so can I arrange that?;;;
external: Give us a couple of days.;;;
external: Please do that, yes.;;;
internal: Alright and do you want?;;;
external: Probably the long run is probably going to be the best thing.;;;
internal: Yes and you want the delivery address to be the same address, yeah, you need fifty six slash, alright. I'm gonna arrange.;;;
external: Yes please, yeah.;;;
external: Sorry, what number fifty six at fifty four road?;;;
internal: Yes, that's the one. yes. I'm gonna arrange that for you and once I get the confirmation from our management, I will get back to you personally and after placing the order for the modem, alright.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Right, thank you.;;;
internal: Alright, I'm sorry that we couldn't.;;;
external: Is that it?;;;
external: Who, who, who will contact me for the, the billing?;;;
internal: Uh, the billing will be, uh, automatically I mean you will be automatically billed, but fifty percent would be waived off from that so you will be charged seventy dollars.;;;
external: Just on my account.;;;
internal: Yes, that will be on the account.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Yeah, that's fine, That's good.;;;
internal: Alright, I'm sorry, we couldn't fix this over the phone but I'm, I'm gonna get this. I mean I'm sure I mean the new modem should work with this since it's preconfigured. It's basically just plug and play. So you just got to remove that yellow cable from the modem and plug it to the same.;;;
external: Well.;;;
internal: On the brand new modem, alright Terence.;;;
external: Okay and it should go, okay.;;;
external: Thanks thanks for Persevering. Thanks for your support.;;;
internal: Thank you very much. Che, alright. You have a good day Cheri.;;;

internal: Hello.;;;
external: Hello, can you hear me?;;;
internal: Yes, I can hear you.;;;
external: Yes, mm, my name is Brenda Mcray. And the reason I'm calling. is that, mm, my credit card was compromised.;;;
external: During the week and so my bank has suspended the credit card.;;;
internal: Okay, okay.;;;
external: And my invoice for El has arrived the day after my credit card was suspended.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
external: So I've got an invoice that hasn't been paid.;;;
internal: Sure.;;;
external: And I can't pay it at the moment because I don't have a credit card.;;;
internal: Yeah, sure, let me see what the options I can give you right to help you out.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: One moment please.;;;

external: Okay.;;;
external: Eight.;;;
external: You say you've just sent a verification code.;;;

external: Ah, yeah, there we go.;;;
external: So that verification is double five one five seven.;;;
internal: One five seven.;;;
internal: Thank you.;;;
internal: Just wait through invoices on nine.;;;
internal: Okay, so your, um.;;;
internal: Last invoice right, which is, which was the one twenty eight hours So you, you could not do the payment for that right.;;;
external: So what did you miss that, could you repeat that?;;;
internal: Uh, yeah, so the fourteenth August invoice.;;;
internal: Uh, which is one twenty eight ago. so that this day before yesterday seventy dollars, so that's the invoice that you couldn't do the payment, right?;;;
external: Yes, that is correct.;;;
external: That's correct, that's right.;;;
internal: Okay, so from the due date twenty eight August usually you have a great period of eight to ten days to do the payment.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
internal: Yeah, so within that eight to ten days period, if you can do the payment, that's fine.;;;
external: The question becomes, I don't know how long, my bank will take to issue new credit cards.;;;
internal: A new, uh, okay, sure, okay. what happens is, uh, they still cannot give the payment extension so after the break period of eight to ten days which I told you after that to me, we can give you payment extension.;;;
external: Now.;;;
internal: So so Brenton, so there is now from twenty eight August to eight to ten days is that somewhere around, uh?;;;
internal: T about that it was sixth or seventh September. I think, yeah, we say six September. So you have time until about six September to do the payment by that day by fifth or six September. It service get suspended or block you could give us a call then at that time we can give you a payment extension.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Okay, so we have to wait for that grace period to run.;;;
internal: Yeah, you to wait til the period finishes yet. so it might be fif September six September seven September. yeah. so on those three days you were getting notification. They said this service is blocked or suspended. Then you give a call at that time then we can give the a payment extension for the payment extension.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Okay, I understand, hmm just as in a side, hmm What I'm doing with my other utilities is, they have a B pay option. So I'm paying the accounts B pay, mm, I'm just wondering why exit doesn't have that.;;;
internal: Bye.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: Yeah, sorry Brenda. We still, we still have not, uh, expected the B pay payment method option.;;;
external: Mhm.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: I mean look, I understand and the path is now clear, I wait until the sixth. and if the card comes in, I then pay which is fine, mm, but just something I get to feedback to your team is whether or not there should be another payment method in case because.;;;
internal: But yeah, sure definitely, yeah.;;;
external: Credit card.;;;

external: A test, hmm. because of I'm having sort of slow slow Internet speed.;;;
external: And anyway the phone got disconnected and I didn't end up getting to do it. So I was just wondering if you could talk me through how so I done like I'm connected directly to the optic box via Ppoe and I can do Internet speed test that's fine. I'm getting about two hundred and seventy.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Megabytes per second there, but he said there was a way we could test the direct line to see if I was, you know able to get a Gigabyte speed.;;;
internal: Ok, could I have your customer Id number so that I can look into that sir?;;;
external: Uh, I don't know my Id number, hmm.;;;
internal: Your mobile number would be fine, yeah.;;;

internal: And along with the state and the post code sir.;;;
external: Post code two two eight four.;;;

internal: Let me check on this. So you said you are connected directly to the optical device, right?;;;
external: Yes, correct.;;;
external: And so I just did a speed test on the, actually to.;;;
external: Website then and I get two hundred and seventy two megabytes.;;;
internal: Two hundred and seventy two megabytes, alright.;;;
external: Em, but I signed up for the.;;;
external: The one gigabyte link, um.;;;
external: Yeah, the last guy, I was talking to said I could do it direct.;;;
external: Test to find out, you know, the, the true speed I could get.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
internal: Alright, mm, can you check whether the cable that you're using? it should be printed on the cable, whether it's a cat five E or a cat six cable?;;;
external: Ah, yeah, pretty sure, let me check, mm.;;;
external: It doesn't actually have it printed on here.;;;
external: Hmm, I can.;;;
external: And I've definitely got.;;;
external: A cat cable, I can swap it out just in case.;;;
internal: Oh, yeah, let's just sort it out and then run a speed test because sometimes cables can have limitations as well.;;;
external: That is it.;;;
internal: So, uh, and before use swap the cables just restart the device, the optum device also.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
external: Yeah, sure on, yeah.;;;
external: Okay, do that now.;;;
external: Bye.;;;
external: It's booting back up now.;;;
internal: Is the optimum device back on?;;;

external: P Ppo connection.;;;
external: Waiting for it to come back online, I think.;;;
external: Ok, I'm connected again.;;;
external: I'll run another speed test.;;;
internal: Yes.;;;
external: So same same sort of slightly worse, two hundred and sixty.;;;
external: Megabytes per second.;;;
external: With that table and I know that one.;;;
internal: Oh, okay. let me, I think there was, uh, this was already with optic and were the instructions provided to us.;;;
internal: Since that is also not working out So we will have to get back to optic and tell them that we did the, uh, the strips that they advise us also.;;;
internal: And since there is no improvement. We'll have to raise this with them. C. so as soon as we do have some feedback on that.;;;
external: Yeah.;;;
internal: We will be getting back to you, alright.;;;
external: Alright, so I did get feedback from them. I think and they said everything looks fine on their end and then the next step was that a technician would come out.;;1;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Mm, but you know if it's, um.;;;
external: Incorrect call out then it's a two hundred dollar fee or whatever.;;;
internal: Yeah, exactly, yeah, but.;;;
external: So yeah, the last guy said before we arranged for that there was a test. I could do.;;;
external: I have to test the direct.;;;
external: Link speed, not the Internet speed is that is that a thing like?;;;
external: To check what, mm, you know, the actual bandwidth capacity is into my.;;;
external: On the unit.;;;
internal: Uh, so, uh, yeah that I think that would be the test that you just did the direct Ppoe connection.;;;
external: Yeah, so that's, yeah, okay. Well, that's what I told him, I've done and he said no, there's another test but.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Um.;;;
internal: Okay.;;;
external: Anyway, I don't know.;;;
internal: If that's the case, yeah, One of our agents will reach out to you and they will advise you on what is going to happen.;;;
internal: All right.;;;
external: Uh.;;;
external: Fine, so yeah, that is the speed I getting to the opt box but then I'm only getting like a hundred and forty to my router.;;;
internal: Hundred and forty to your road and you said the pp direct is about two hundred and sixty six, right.;;;
external: Okay.;;;
external: Yeah, yeah, two sixty two seventy, normally for the direct.;;;
internal: Alright.;;;
external: Then hit my router, it's only a hundred and forty, I had the issue with my.;;;
external: Previous provider.;;;
external: Mm, I'll on a two hundred and fifty megabyte, mm connection with them. And I was only getting around a hundred and forty and what they ended up having to do was change my connection from, mm.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: Ppo to hmm to a dynamic.;;;
external: Um.;;;
external: So you don't put your username and password in.;;;
internal: Yeah.;;;
external: And then all of a sudden that fixed, it was getting like two hundred and fifty Meb bits per second like my router so.;;;
internal: Okay, yeah.;;;
external: I don't know, is there an option with you guys.;;;
internal: I'm sorry, I didn't.;;;
external: Is that an option with you guys, can we change from a?;;;
internal: Hmm, I will have to check that since it's already address with the supplier. Uh, we might have to check that and get back to you with regards to that. So we will be notifying you on what steps can be taken anywhere since we have already raised this.;;;

external: Okay.;;;
internal: Okay, so let me know if there's any change like if the broadband light comes lights up, yeah.;;;
external: By.;;;
external: Okay, okay. okay. I plugged it back. So I've just plugged into the wall to the same slot as the yellow cable was in and I've used the Dsl slot on the router.;;;
external: I am waiting, it doesn't.;;;
external: Seem to have brought on any different lights. I've still showing three green which is power two point four G and five G.;;;
